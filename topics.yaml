    When we leverage crypto, we are tapping into cosmic energy to lend us
    strength in our struggle for freedom. As governments wage war on crypto
    markets, we are forced to reach deep into our wellspring of wisdom, and
    summon the most powerful spirits from deep within nature.

    In a world where ever-increasing surveillance has become the new norm,
    privacy is a necessity. But it’s not easy to build your own privacy setup,
    as it requires many components: resources, infrastructure, and most
    importantly - tools and protocols that can’t compromise or give away your
    data.


    Cyphernet's goal is to bring such tools to the masses thus empowering

    Every new government's regulation, restriction or embargo that makes

    obstacles. The fact - how many entrepreneurs or ordinary citizens consider
    the given law to be unethical, willing to avoid with the least risk as
    possible, determines an economic feasibility of the 'avoidance' solution.

    solvable. The solution is an anonymous insurance company.

    the individual to act does not necessarily empower the individual to deal

    After describing the system all of the ways that the system could be
    attacked are cataloged. For each of those threats the security researcher
    provides the safeguards, if any, that attempt to prevent the attack and his
    own judgement on the likely success of an attack.


    By applying this technique to bitcoin we get a much clearer view of its

    Cryptoanarchy is all the buzz, but it has become a brand lacking content.
    There's a real risk of losing track of the liberating possibilities of
    cryptography while focusing on riding the cryptocurrency bandwagon,
    repeating memes and hanging on to false assumptions. It's time to put
    anarchy back into cryptography! Coercion must be analyzed and understood to
    be able to discover how cryptography can become a tool to undermine power
    and prepare the grounds for less violent social structures. From there, a
    field of exploration opens itself to those who are interested in
    experimenting with societal structures never seen before in human history.

- name: Scarcity In Crypto Networks
  desc: >-
    Physical goods have some properties that are very hard to replicate in the
    digital realm. Scarcity is one such property. Many attempts have been made
    to create scarce digital goods by adding artificial rules and constraints.
    But information (including software) can be easily copied, networks can be
    forked, and rules can be changed or broken. What does it actually mean for a
    digital good to be scarce? And what are the implications for cryptocurrency?
    What makes one digital good have stronger scarcity guarantees than another?
    Can we rely on built-in incentives or does it require external enforcement?
    We explore these issues drawing examples from existing networks.

    came about, why it was and remains to be important and what are the major
    differences between peer-2-peer, decentralized and regular exchanges.
    Different kinds of multisig contracts such as “2 out 2” and “2 out of 3”

    Many people perceive the current jurisprudence as a fair and impartial

    that the whole system continues to operate empowered by the myth of the rule
    of law. The decisions of the judges are thoroughly unpredictable these days.
    Even though it can be hard to survive in such a system, it is possible to
    create a tribe, where we can liberate ourselves and preserve internal trust.
    All that based on paradoxes emerged from the case law. A new level of the
    trust can be reached by applying these legal paradoxes in combination with

    to legitimacy are deliberately made invisible. This is the shadowy,
    surprisingly large, and literally unofficial world of countries that don’t

    Digital technology is being developed with little or no awareness of the
    underlying operating system: corporate capitalism. New technologies are
    developed purely for their ability to extract value from people and places,
    instead of providing human beings with the capabilities they need to create
    and exchange value for themselves. As a result, we now live in a media
    environment where technologies use people more than people use technology. 


    One of the greatest promises of new media technologies was to unlock
    closed-ended narratives and offer people the opportunity to participate,
    actively, in the creation of a new human story. In this talk, media theorist
