  description: |
    Cypherpunk is a political and social movement that emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s, advocating for the use of strong [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) and privacy-enhancing technologies as a means to achieve social and political change. The term "cypherpunk" is a combination of "cipher" (or "cypher") and "[cyberpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk)". Cypherpunks believe that privacy is essential for an open society in the electronic age and see strong cryptography as a tool to preserve civil liberties against government overreach and corporate surveillance.

    At its core, [Cypherpunk philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk) is characterized by a distrust of authority, advocacy for [privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy) as a fundamental right, and the belief that code can be used to create systems that enforce desired social and political norms. This ideology was formalized in the [Cypherpunk's Manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html), written by Eric Hughes in 1993. Notable figures associated with the cypherpunk movement include [Julian Assange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange), [Adam Back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Back), and [Wei Dai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wei_Dai).

    The impact of cypherpunk philosophy has been significant, influencing the development of [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) like [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin), anonymous communication systems such as [Tor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)), and advancing encryption technologies. It continues to play a crucial role in ongoing debates about digital privacy, surveillance, and individual sovereignty in the digital age. The philosophy emphasizes the creation of parallel, decentralized structures that prioritize privacy, freedom, and individual autonomy in the face of increasing digital surveillance and control.

    Digital Self-Defense refers to the practices and techniques individuals use to protect their [digital privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_privacy), security, and personal information in the face of increasing online threats and surveillance. It encompasses a wide range of skills and tools designed to safeguard one's digital presence, communications, and data from unauthorized access, manipulation, or exploitation.

    At its core, Digital Self-Defense is about empowering individuals to take control of their digital lives. This includes understanding and mitigating risks associated with [online tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_tracking), [data collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection), and cyber attacks. Key aspects of Digital Self-Defense include the use of [encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) for secure communications, [virtual private networks (VPNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) for anonymous browsing, [two-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) for account security, and [digital hygiene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberhygiene) practices like regular software updates and strong password management.

    The concept of Digital Self-Defense has gained prominence with the rise of [mass surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance), [data breaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach), and sophisticated cyber threats. It's closely related to the idea of [information self-determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_self-determination), which asserts an individual's right to control the collection and use of their personal data. As digital technologies become increasingly integrated into daily life, Digital Self-Defense is becoming an essential skill for maintaining personal freedom, privacy, and security in the digital age.
