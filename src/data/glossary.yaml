  description: |
    Cypherpunk is a political and social movement that emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s, advocating for the use of strong [[cryptography]] and privacy-enhancing technologies as a means to achieve social and political change.
    
    The term "cypherpunk" is a combination of "cipher" (or "cypher") and "[[cyberpunk]]". Cypherpunks believe that privacy is essential for an open society in the electronic age and see strong cryptography as a tool to preserve civil liberties against government overreach and corporate surveillance.

    At its core, Cypherpunk philosophy is characterized by a distrust of authority, advocacy for [[privacy]] as a fundamental right, and the belief that code can be used to create systems that enforce desired social and political norms. This ideology was formalized in the [[Cypherpunk's Manifesto]], written by Eric Hughes in 1993. Notable figures associated with the cypherpunk movement include [Julian Assange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange), [Adam Back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Back), and [Wei Dai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wei_Dai).

    The impact of cypherpunk philosophy has been significant, influencing the development of [[cryptocurrencies]] like [[Bitcoin]], anonymous communication systems such as [[Tor]], and advancing encryption technologies. It continues to play a crucial role in ongoing debates about digital privacy, surveillance, and individual sovereignty in the digital age. The philosophy emphasizes the creation of parallel, decentralized structures that prioritize privacy, freedom, and individual autonomy in the face of increasing digital surveillance and control.

  description: |
    Encryption is the process of encoding information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it. It converts data into a form that appears random to anyone who doesn't have the decryption key. Encryption is a fundamental component of data security and privacy in the digital age, protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access, interception, and tampering.

    At its core, encryption relies on complex mathematical algorithms called [ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher). Modern encryption methods typically use a [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography)) to determine how the information is encoded and decoded. There are two main types of encryption: [[symmetric-key encryption]], where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, and [[public-key encryption]], where a public key is used to encrypt data and a private key to decrypt it. 

    Encryption plays a crucial role in various aspects of digital life, including secure communication ([[HTTPS]], [[end-to-end encryption]], data storage ([[full disk encryption]]), and authentication processes. It's also fundamental to technologies like [[virtual private networks (VPNs)]] and [[cryptocurrencies]]. As digital threats evolve, so do encryption methods, with ongoing research into [[quantum-resistant encryption]] to prepare for future challenges. Despite its importance for privacy and security, encryption remains a topic of debate, with ongoing discussions about [[encryption policies|crypto wars]] and law enforcement access.

    Privacy is the right of an individual or group to control information about themselves and determine when, how, and to what extent this information is communicated to others. In the digital age, privacy has become increasingly complex and crucial, encompassing not only physical space but also digital data and online activities.

    At its core, privacy is about personal autonomy and the ability to make choices free from observation or interference. It includes concepts like [[information privacy]] (control over personal data), [[communications privacy]] (freedom from surveillance of communications), and [[bodily privacy|physical privacy]] (control over one's physical self). In the digital realm, privacy concerns extend to [[data collection]], [[online tracking]], and the use of personal information by governments and corporations.

    Privacy is protected by various legal frameworks, including the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights) and specific legislation like the [EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation). However, it faces significant challenges in the era of big data, social media, and [[mass surveillance]]. The balance between privacy and other interests, such as national security or technological innovation, remains a subject of ongoing debate. Privacy-enhancing technologies, including [[encryption]]), [[anonymity networks]], and [[privacy-preserving computation]], are increasingly important tools for protecting individual privacy in the digital world.

    Anarchocapitalism is a political philosophy and economic theory that advocates for the elimination of the state in favor of individual sovereignty, private property, and [[free markets]]. It combines anarchism's rejection of the state with capitalism's emphasis on private ownership and voluntary exchange.

    At its core, anarchocapitalism proposes a society based on voluntary associations among individuals and private organizations. It argues that all goods and services, including law enforcement, courts, and defense, should be provided by privately funded competitors rather than through taxation and government monopolies. Key principles include the [[non-aggression principle]] (NAP), which opposes the initiation of force against individuals or their property, and strong protection of [[property rights]].

    Prominent thinkers associated with anarchocapitalism include [Murray Rothbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rothbard), who developed its foundational theory, and [David Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_D._Friedman), who approached it from a consequentialist perspective. The philosophy has influenced various movements, including some strands of [[libertarianism]] and [[crypto-anarchism]]. However, it has faced criticism from both traditional anarchists, who view capitalism as inherently hierarchical and oppressive, and from other political philosophies that argue for the necessity of the state in maintaining social order and providing public goods. Critics also question the practicality of private law and defense systems proposed by anarchocapitalists.

    Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security, operating on decentralized networks based on [[blockchain technology]]. Unlike traditional currencies issued by central banks, cryptocurrencies are typically not subject to governmental monetary policies and often aim to provide alternatives to conventional financial systems.

    At their core, cryptocurrencies rely on distributed ledger technology, most commonly blockchain, to record all transactions across a network of computers. This system ensures transparency, security, and immutability of transaction records without the need for a central authority. Key features include [[decentralization]], [[pseudonymity]], and the use of [[consensus mechanisms]] like [[Proof of Work]] or [[Proof of Stake]] to validate transactions and create new units of the currency.

    [[Bitcoin]], created in 2009 by an unknown person or group using the pseudonym [[Satoshi Nakamoto]], was the first and remains the most well-known cryptocurrency. Since then, thousands of alternative cryptocurrencies (often called "altcoins") have been created, with [[Ethereum]], Litecoin, Solana among the more prominent ones. Beyond serving as digital money, many cryptocurrencies support additional features like [[smart contracts]] and [[decentralized applications (DApps)]]. While cryptocurrencies have gained significant attention and adoption, they also face challenges including price volatility, regulatory scrutiny, and concerns about their environmental impact, particularly for those using energy-intensive mining processes.

    "Paralelní Polis" (Parallel Polis) is an influential [essay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essay) written by Czech philosopher and political dissident [Václav Benda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A1clav_Benda) in 1978. The essay introduced the concept of creating parallel structures within society as a means of resistance against totalitarian regimes, particularly in the context of [Communist Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Czechoslovakia). Benda's work became a foundational text for the [Czech dissident movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_77) and had a significant impact on political thought in Eastern Europe.

    The core idea of the essay is that citizens should establish independent social, cultural, and economic institutions that operate outside the control of the authoritarian state. These parallel structures would serve as alternatives to official institutions, allowing people to live more freely and authentically while gradually eroding the power of the oppressive regime. Benda argued that this approach could create a "parallel polis" - a shadow society that embodies the values and freedoms suppressed by the totalitarian government.

    The concept of Paralelní Polis influenced the development of [civil society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society) in Eastern Europe during the late 20th century and played a role in the peaceful resistance that ultimately led to the [fall of communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989) in the region. The essay's ideas continue to resonate in contemporary discussions about grassroots organizing, decentralized systems, and resistance to authoritarian power structures. Today, the concept has been adopted by various groups seeking to create alternative social and economic models, including [[cryptocurrency]] advocates and proponents of decentralized technologies.

    Cryptoanarchy is a political philosophy and technological movement that advocates for the use of strong [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) and privacy-enhancing technologies to advance individual liberty, economic freedom, and political autonomy. Emerging in the late 1980s with the [[Cypherpunk]] movement, cryptoanarchy draws inspiration from [[anarchist]] and [[libertarian]] ideals, as well as from technological innovations in computer science and cryptography.

    Central to cryptoanarchist thought is the belief that widespread adoption of encryption, [anonymous networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_P2P), and [decentralized systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_computing) can fundamentally reshape social and economic structures by undermining state surveillance, censorship, and financial control. Key figures like [Timothy May](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_C._May) and [Eric Hughes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Hughes_(cypherpunk)) laid the groundwork for the movement, advocating for tools such as [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency), [secure communication protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_communication), and [smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) to create autonomous digital spaces beyond government reach.

    The cryptoanarchist vision has significantly influenced technological development, inspiring projects like [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin), [Tor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)), and [WikiLeaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks). However, the movement faces criticism for potentially enabling illegal activities and undermining necessary societal functions. The ongoing debate surrounding cryptoanarchy encompasses issues of [digital rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights), [online privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_privacy), [financial regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_regulation), and the balance between individual freedom and collective security in the digital age.

    Mass surveillance refers to the widespread, often covert monitoring of large populations' communications, movements, and activities by governments, corporations, or other entities. This practice has existed for centuries but has dramatically expanded in scope and sophistication with the advent of digital technologies and the internet. Modern mass surveillance employs a variety of methods, including intercepting telecommunications, [[monitoring internet activity|internet surveillance]], and collecting [[biometric data|biometrics]].

    Proponents argue that mass surveillance is necessary for national security, crime prevention, and counterterrorism efforts. Programs like the NSA's [[PRISM]] in the United States and China's [[Golden Shield Project]] exemplify large-scale government surveillance initiatives. However, these practices have sparked intense debate about the balance between security and [[privacy rights]], with critics arguing that mass surveillance threatens civil liberties, chills free speech, and can lead to abuse of power.

    The global discourse on mass surveillance gained significant momentum following the [2013 revelations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present)) by [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden), which exposed the extent of surveillance programs conducted by the [[Five Eyes]] intelligence alliance. These disclosures led to increased public awareness, legal challenges, and efforts to develop stronger [[encryption]] and privacy-preserving technologies. The ongoing tension between surveillance practices and privacy rights continues to shape policy debates, technological development, and international relations in the digital age.

    Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant record-keeping without the need for a central authority. First conceptualized by [[Satoshi Nakamoto]] in 2008 as the underlying technology for [[Bitcoin]], blockchain has since evolved into a broader technological framework with applications far beyond cryptocurrencies.

    At its core, a blockchain is a chain of blocks containing digital information, cryptographically linked and replicated across a network of computers. Each block typically contains a set of transactions or data, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block, creating an immutable and auditable history. The decentralized nature of blockchain systems, coupled with [[consensus mechanisms]] like [[Proof of Work]] or [[Proof of Stake]], ensures data integrity and resistance to manipulation.

    While initially associated primarily with [[cryptocurrencies]], blockchain technology has found diverse applications across industries. [[Smart contracts]], self-executing agreements with the terms directly written into code, have enabled the development of [[decentralized finance (DeFi)]] platforms and [[non-fungible tokens (NFTs)]]. Beyond finance, blockchain is being explored for use in supply chain management, voting systems, identity verification, and other fields where transparency, traceability, and trust are paramount. Despite its potential, blockchain technology faces challenges including scalability, energy consumption, and regulatory uncertainties.

    Bitcoin is the world's first decentralized [[cryptocurrency]], introduced in 2009 by an anonymous entity known as [[Satoshi Nakamoto]]. It operates on a [[peer-to-peer]] network without the need for intermediaries, using [[blockchain]] technology to maintain a public ledger of all transactions. Bitcoin was created as a response to the 2008 financial crisis, aiming to provide a currency independent of central banks and government control.

    The core innovation of Bitcoin lies in its solution to the [[double-spending problem]] and its [[consensus mechanism]] known as [[Proof of Work]]. This system allows for secure, verifiable transactions without a trusted third party. Bitcoin has a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, with new bitcoins created through a process called [[mining|cryptocurrency mining]], where powerful computers solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain.

    Since its inception, Bitcoin has grown from a niche interest among cryptography enthusiasts to a global financial phenomenon. It has inspired the creation of thousands of other cryptocurrencies and sparked debates about the future of money, financial privacy, and monetary policy. While proponents view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a tool for financial sovereignty, critics point to its price volatility, environmental concerns due to energy-intensive mining, and its use in illicit activities. Despite controversies, Bitcoin continues to evolve, with developments like the [[Lightning Network]] aiming to address scalability issues.

    Proof of Work (PoW) is a [[consensus mechanism]] and spam prevention system first developed to combat email spam and later adapted for use in cryptocurrencies, most notably [[Bitcoin]]. It requires participants (often called miners) to expend computational effort solving complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks in a blockchain.

    In a PoW system, miners compete to solve a cryptographic hash function with a specific level of difficulty. The first miner to find a solution that meets the required criteria broadcasts it to the network for verification. If valid, the new block is added to the blockchain, and the successful miner is rewarded with newly minted cryptocurrency and transaction fees. This process serves multiple purposes: it secures the network against attacks, distributes new currency, and provides a decentralized method for reaching consensus on the state of the ledger.

    While PoW has proven to be a robust and secure system for cryptocurrencies, it has faced criticism for its high energy consumption and potential for centralization as mining becomes more resource-intensive. These concerns have led to the development of alternative consensus mechanisms like [[Proof of Stake]] and explorations into more energy-efficient PoW algorithms. Despite these challenges, PoW remains a fundamental concept in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, underpinning the security and operation of many blockchain networks.

    A consensus mechanism is a fault-tolerant protocol used in [[blockchain]] systems and distributed computing to achieve agreement on a single data value or state of the network among distributed processes or multi-agent systems. In the context of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, consensus mechanisms ensure that all nodes in the network agree on the validity of transactions and the order in which they are added to the ledger.

    The most well-known consensus mechanisms include [[Proof of Work (PoW)]], used by [[Bitcoin]], and [[Proof of Stake (PoS)]], employed by [[Ethereum]] and other cryptocurrencies. Other notable mechanisms include [[Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)]], [[Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)]], and [[Proof of Authority (PoA)]]. Each mechanism has its own set of trade-offs in terms of security, decentralization, scalability, and energy efficiency.

    Consensus mechanisms play a crucial role in solving the [[Byzantine Generals' Problem|Byzantine fault]] in distributed systems, ensuring that the network can reach agreement even in the presence of malicious actors or faulty nodes. The choice of consensus mechanism significantly impacts a blockchain's performance, security model, and overall design. As the field evolves, researchers and developers continue to explore new consensus algorithms to address limitations of existing models and to meet the specific needs of various blockchain applications.

    Free market refer to an economic system in which prices for goods and services are determined by open competition between privately owned businesses, without significant government intervention or regulation. This concept is fundamental to [classical liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism) and [laissez-faire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire) economic theories, emphasizing voluntary exchange, private property rights, and minimal government interference in economic activities.

    In a free market economy, supply and demand are the primary forces driving the allocation of resources, production decisions, and price determination. Proponents argue that this system leads to greater economic efficiency, innovation, and individual freedom. They contend that the "invisible hand" of the market, a concept introduced by [Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith), guides self-interested actors to produce socially beneficial outcomes. Free market advocates often support policies such as deregulation, privatization, and free trade.

    Critics of free market ideology argue that unregulated markets can lead to [market failures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure), extreme inequality, and environmental degradation. They contend that some level of government intervention is necessary to address externalities, provide public goods, and ensure fair competition. The debate between free market proponents and those advocating for various degrees of [market regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_regulation) or alternative economic systems continues to shape political and economic discourse worldwide. In practice, most modern economies are [mixed systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_economy) that combine elements of free markets with varying degrees of government intervention and regulation.
