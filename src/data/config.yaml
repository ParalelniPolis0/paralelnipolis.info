  Welcome to **Parallel Polis**, a global online-first open community inspired by the concept of creating parallel social structures in society. Our roots trace back to Václav Benda's 1978 ["Paralelní Polis" essay](/t/paralelni-polis-essay) and the [Prague-based initiative](/s/pp-prague) (2014-2024), but today we operate as an independent global movement focused on empowering individuals through technology, education, and collaborative innovation.
