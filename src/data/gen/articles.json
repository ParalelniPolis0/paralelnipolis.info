    "html": "<p>After eleven years, the Prague instance of Paralelní Polis may be winding down, but the ideals it presented are more relevant than ever. The need for alternative structures – systems that operate outside traditional frameworks – has only grown stronger. The closure of the physical location isn't a sign of waning interest, but rather an opportunity for evolution.</p><p>From this transition emerges PP0, a digital-first continuation of Paralelní Polis's core principles. Freed from the constraints of a physical building, PP0 aims to be a global, decentralized network of forward-thinking individuals. It will serve as a platform for preserving and sharing knowledge, exploring new forms of digital autonomy, and educating the public about tools for personal and collective empowerment.</p>",
