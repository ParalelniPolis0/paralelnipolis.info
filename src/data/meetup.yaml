    🍻 Calling all Bitcoiners and beer lovers 🍻


    Hey there!


    Last year's beer bash on the terrace of Paralelní Polis was an absolute
    blast, wasn't it? Oh yes, last year we couldn't resist a cheeky glance over
    at our Ethereum friends 😏, and let's just say, it was quite the spectacle.


    Well, guess what? We're doing it again, and this time it's going to be even
    better!


    Join us on Sunday, June 16th, for a laid-back, post-conference hangout where
    Bitcoiners from near and far can come together and unwind before heading
    back to reality.


    So mark your calendars, spread the word, and get ready to raise a glass to
    another unforgettable evening in the epicenter of Prague's crypto scene.


    See you there! ⚡

    ##### **Welcome to the 3rd annual Pizza Day Prague!**


    As we gather once again to celebrate the evolution of Bitcoin and its impact
    on our world, this year’s conference explores a crucial battleground.


    The Scaling Wars represent a pivotal moment in Bitcoin’s journey, a battle
    to address the growing pains and ensure the continued relevance of
    peer-to-peer electronic cash. As the demand for Bitcoin transactions rises,
    questions about network capacity, transaction speed, and fees become
    increasingly urgent. The decentralization ethos that underpins Bitcoin’s
    essence faces challenges as the community navigates the delicate balance
    between scalability and maintaining the trustless nature of the network.


    The Scaling Wars encompass not only technical considerations but also
    ideological discussions about the very soul of Bitcoin. Should we prioritize
    on-chain scaling or explore layer-two solutions? How do we ensure
    inclusivity and avoid centralization without compromising efficiency?


    Together, we can navigate the challenges of scaling, foster innovation, and
    ensure that the original spirit of Bitcoin thrives in the face of adversity.
    Join us in Prague for Pizza Day 2024 – where the aroma of freshly baked
    ideas and the zest of intellectual exchange promise to make this a landmark
    event in the ongoing saga of Bitcoin’s evolution.

    Vstupte do světa, kde se hranice komfortní zóny neznají limit a domov je
    tam, kde otevřete laptop 🌴


    Jmenuji se Denisa a zvu vás na přednášku ‘Za hranicemi komfortní zóny i
    domova: Život v Panamě’, kde se podělím o svůj příběh odvahy, adaptability a
    nekonečného objevování 🤩


    Připravte se na průvodce životem, který je stejně neotřelý a otevřený, jako
    jsem já – od pražských ulic a sterilních officů až do srdce Latinské
    Ameriky, můžu vám rozšířit pohled na nový způsob myšlení a práce. Na této
    cestě prozkoumáme, jaké to je žít v Panamě, vzdorovat kultuře jako cizinec
    👀, navigovat byrokracií a korupci 💸, a zároveň objevovat krásu tropického
    raje 🦥🌴.


    Sdílím s vámi, jak se dá využít remote práce a AI k vytvoření života bez
    omezení ✨. Budete mít možnost nahlédnout do zákulisí indiánských kultur,
    politických intrik a skutečného života v džungli s notebookem 👩🏼‍💻 Tato
    přednáška vám otevře oči a možná i dveře k vaší vlastní cestě za hranice
    běžného.


    Přijďte objevit, jak můžete změnit svůj život, rozšířit obzory a možná najít
    inspiraci k tomu, abyste i vy udělali ten první krok za hranici komfortní
    zóny🚀


    Těším se na vás a na sdílení těchto inspirativních okamžiků 🪐

    In this two-part event we’ll introduce the Nym mixnet, a cutting-edge
    decentralized privacy system that makes traffic anonymous. The Nym mixnet
    encrypts your data and, with unique 5-hop traffic shuffling, also protects
    your patterns of communication: your metadata.


    And we’ll run and test NymVPN, a client that makes the mixnet accessible to
    anyone.


    Whether you’re running MacOS or Linux, bring your laptop and join a live
    workshop where you can connect with other privacy enthusiasts - and help us
    build the future private internet, free from surveillance.

    For over 5000 years, an underground war has played out between state
    civilization and free society.


    This war is not merely a physical one, but a spiritual war.

    Today the struggle continues. Life evolves and moves upwards through the
    efforts of society. The state as a parasite harvests this human energy for
    its own survival.


    But grand events are playing out. The pendulum swings towards freedom. This
    is the hour. Cyber-guerillas rise up!


    **RESISTANCE IS LIFE!**


    Speakers line-up includes Richard Stallman, Cody Wilson, Jarrad Hope, Ryan
    Lackey, Rachel-Rose O'Leary, Mitch Altman, Bob Summerwill, Paul Rosenberg,
    Silke Noa, Harry Halpin, Max Hillebrand, Scott Beibin and many more!

    **[hcpp.cz](http://hcpp.cz/)**

    *[Hackers Congress Paralelní Polis](https://1337.hcpp.cz/) (HCPP) is the
    flagship event of Paralelní Polis, which since 2014 has been regularly
    attended by over 500 fans and IT experts from all over the world. HCPP is
    held annually in Prague on the first weekend of October.*


    *The main thematic pillars of the three-day congress are Freedom &
    Cryptoanarchy, Decentralized Economics, & Cryptocurrencies, Political Art &
    Hacking, and Science & Technology.*

    during Protocol Berg failed and the next attempt ( 😏 ) is planned for
    September 28th, 14:00 CEST.


    We will meet in the hackerspace, which already served as a slayer of the
    Ropsten testnet, to witness the launch of the first long-standing,
    merged-from-genesis, public Ethereum testnet. Holešky will replace Goerli as
    a staking, infrastructure, and protocol-developer testnet maintained by the
    community. The name comes Holešovice, part of Prague where the hackerspace
    is located which makes it the best place to witness its genesis.

    Zveme vás na neuvěřitelný event plný inovace a technologického pokroku -
    Kyborgismus AND: Meet the founders!


    Připojte se k nám 28. července 2023 od 17:45 v pražské Paralelní Polis a
    setkejte se s vizionáři a zakladateli projektu Kyborgismu, Krisem a Dodo.

    vlivu na společnost.


    Paralelní Polis, ohromující prostor spojující umění, společenské vědy a
    moderní technologie, poskytne kulisu této události. Jako nezávislá nezisková
    organizace, Paralelní Polis se staví na idejích svobody a inovace. Jejich
    koncept 'state-free' vám ukáže, jak můžeme žít bez závislosti na tradičních
    strukturách.


    Těšte se na inspirativní přednášky od zakladatelů Krise a Dodo, kteří vám
    přiblíží své vášnivé zájmy v oblasti matematiky, nových technologií, 3D
    tisku, umělé inteligence, kyborgismu a biologických/zdravotních směrů. A to
    není vše! Na eventu vás čekají také tajní bonusoví hosté, kteří vám
    představí další fascinující aspekty kyborgismu.


    Přidejte se k nám na tomto jedinečném setkání, abyste objevili budoucnost,
    kterou kyborgismus přináší. Získejte vzácnou příležitost diskutovat s
    odborníky, navázat nové kontakty a získat inspiraci pro své vlastní
    projekty. Buďte součástí revoluce v oblasti technologií a společenského
    rozvoje.


    Tato událost je otevřena veřejnosti, avšak kapacita je omezena.
    Zaregistrujte se co nejdříve a zajistěte si své místo na Kyborgismus AND:
    Meet the founders! Ujistěte se, že nezmeškáte toto výjimečné setkání v
    Paralelní Polis.

    **Paralelní Polis brings you another Pizza Day Prague!**


    **The pizza-2-pizza conference is a call to arms for advocates of Bitcoin as
    peer-to-peer technology.**


    A dozen years have passed since the first trade of pizza for Bitcoin. Today,
    we celebrate the widespread popularity and adoption of this delicious dish.
    It has been embraced by individuals, businesses, and even national
    governments. We are truly witnessing the rise of the hyper-pizzanization of
    our world.


    Yet, just as the pizza industry has evolved from sit-down restaurants to
    delivery services to frozen pizzas, the Bitcoin ecosystem has similarly
    moved from face-to-face transactions to third-party intermediaries. But just
    as frozen pizzas can never truly replace the experience of a freshly-made
    pie, third parties can never fully replace the trustless nature of P2P
    transactions.


    We believe that by using Bitcoin as intended, a peer-to-peer electronic cash
    system, we can create a more secure, efficient, and fair financial system.
    We reject the need for third parties and spofs, and extol cryptography to
    empower truly trustless systems. P2P technologies not only enable more
    robust and smooth economic structures, but most importantly they bring
    global coordination without the need for hierarchies. Still, we must resist
    the temptation to build walls and instead strive to create bridges,
    fostering a culture of technological meritocracy and collaboration.


    As contemporary cypherpunks, it is our duty to fight for the ideals of
    decentralization and trustlessness in the face of challenges from
    governments, the public, and even within our own communities. As Bitcoin
    allows us to connect directly with one another without the need for trusted
    third parties, so too can we envision a future where pizza enthusiasts can
    savor their favorite dish without intermediaries.


    Join us in the fight for a decentralized future where the power of
    peer-to-peer technology enables true pizza freedom for all. Let us embrace
    the power of the pizza-to-pizza revival and celebrate the genuine spirit of
    the original Bitcoin pizza transaction.

    Are you fascinated by the way ideas spread and shape human behavior? Do you
    want to gain a deeper understanding of the cultural forces that shape our
    world? Then join us for a Memetics Meetup!


    Memetics is the study of how ideas, beliefs, and cultural practices spread
    from person to person. It’s a way of understanding how human consciousness
    is shaped by the memes that surround us – from the catchy songs that get
    stuck in our heads, to the political slogans that shape our beliefs.


    But memetics isn’t just about understanding how things spread. It’s also
    about understanding how we can hack the system around us. By understanding
    how memes work, we can learn to create more powerful and effective ideas and
    spread them more efficiently. This is especially important in today’s world,
    where the way we think and act is increasingly shaped by the digital world.


    We’ll have a great time discussing the latest research and theories about
    memetics, and you’ll leave with a deeper understanding of how human
    consciousness works. See you there!

    Dankshard.


    At the heart of this ceremony lies a powerful device that harvests
    randomness, drawing from the chaotic sources that lurk within our universe.
    Using a specially designed contraption that collects entropy from the feline
    species, we will explore the limits of our understanding of randomness and
    harness its power to unlock the mysteries of Ethereum's scalability.


    This will not be an ordinary workshop, as we push the boundaries of what is
    possible and venture into the unknown. As we summon the spirit of Dankshard,
    humans may find themselves transformed into feline avatars, blurring the
    lines between reality and fantasy. So join us, and prepare to unlock the
    secrets of the universe as we delve into the space of chaos and cats.

    Paralelní Polis origins in a concept developed during communist regime
    oppression in 70´and 80´in Czechoslovakia. However, the core principles
    appear throughout the whole history of humankind. Even though we live in a
    “digital age” the history of parallel societies gives us a very rich source
    of inspiration, strategies, and tips on how to prevent our lives from
    unwanted interference of power holders. Paralelní polis itself has operated
    for eight years already and experimented with many many ways parallel
    society can and can not work – let´s recapitulate some lessons learned.


    Martin Leskovjan is a co-founder of Paralelní Polis, InfoSec professional,
    lawyer, literature geek, and wild water lover.


    You will have a unique opportunity to meet Martin and ask him anything you
    want at this meetup!

    Lightning Network odpoutal Bitcoin z řetězu a otevřel nám tak nové možnosti.
    Lightning jsme zatím vnímali jako novou kapitolu škálovatelnosti Bitcoinu,
    avšak postupně odhaluje svůj další potenciál. Nabízejí se možnosti
    tokenizace v rámci samotné Lightning Network - stablecoiny, arbitrární
    tokeny a decentralizované burzy na nativní druhé vrstvě Bitcoinu. Ty všechny
    dnes existují a v blízké budoucnosti se mohou stát našimi každodenními
    nástroji.


    Na meetupu se seznámíte s různými projekty, které tyto technologie
    implementují, s jejich fungováním a problémy. Po přednášce bude prostor pro
    diskusi a tradiční párty v Bordelu!

    They took a shot at privacy, building surveillance systems.


    They took a shot at encryption, saying surveillance cannot work if we don’t
    give them keys.


    They took a shot at anonymity, with face recognition, profiling, social
    credit scores.


    We were hiding in a masked crowd.


    They took a shot at financial communication, counterfeiting units of money
    and taking the wealth of the society for themselves.


    They enlisted their friendly corporations to supply them with the bullets of
    control and oppression.

    Za poslední roky si prošla Bitcoin kultura velkým přerodem - od malé party
    geeků, hackerů a kryptoanarchistů se po pár vlnách adopce Bitcoin stal
    mainstreamovou záležitostí. Každá tato vlna však za sebou zanechává spoušť,
    smývá původní idee a narativy o Bitcoinu sa rychle mění. Přijďte se naučit o
    výzvách, kterým Bitcoin a jeho komunita dnes čelí a podiskutovat o
    retrospektivě Bitcoin hnutí.

    **COME TO CELEBRATE THE MERGE IN THE LEGENDARY BORDEL HACKERSPACE w/ Mario
    Havel!**


    **THE MERGE**


    * Soon, the current Ethereum Mainnet will merge with the Beacon Chain
    proof-of-stake system.

    * This will mark the end of proof-of-work for Ethereum and the complete
    transition to proof-of-stake.

    * This sets the stage for future scaling upgrades including sharding.

    * The Merge will reduce Ethereum’s energy consumption by \~99.95%.


    The evening will begin at 6 pm with a special Merge fusion dinner prepared
    by Kate from [sci-fi Kitchen](https://www.instagram.com/kitchen.scifi/).


    The number of seats is limited. Book yours
    [HERE](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/Hul7uVeO5qJOm74WdA8ImKNIYj4xSQ+k51TGnrhwtFM/)
    as soon as possible !


    **BRING YOUR [BORDEL.WTF](https://BORDEL.WTF) POAP TO GET A SPECIAL
    PRESENT!**


    Bordel is a small community hackerspace located in the basement of Paralelní
    Polis. Basically, it’s room with a modular setup suitable for work, hacking

    Uklidnění a koncentrace nebo energie a kreativita. To jsou benefity práce s
    dechem, kterých můžeme dosáhnout všichni během pár minut. Přijď si na
    praktický workshop do Paralelní Polis vyzkoušet, jaký vliv bude mít vědomé
    dýchání na tebe. Úplně jednoduše. Prostým dýcháním s pozorností.


    obrať_se_dovnitř

    vejdi_ven

    hni_se


    Dobře se o sebe starej. Vedení začíná uvnitř. Nemůžeš být zdrojem energie,
    jestliže žádnou nemáš. Jestliže se Ti nedostává dechu, nemůžeš pro ostatní
    udělat nic. Udělej si čas na péči sám o sebe. Dveře k úspěchu, se totiž
    otevírají směrem ven.

    Poprvé se nadechneme, když se narodíme. Naposledy vydechneme, když zemřeme.

    Dýchání nás provází celým životem. Budhisté tvrdí, že počet nádechů za život
    je nám dán a je na nás, jak s nimi naložíme. A také tvrdí, že délka života
    se neměří léty, ale počtem nádechů.


    Workshop bude probíhat v přítmí s evokativní hudbou a většinu času vleže,
    bez bot na karimatkách. Volnější oblečení výhodou. Před workshopem je
    doporučeno minimálně hodinu a půl nejíst. Nedoporučuje se těhotným ženám,
    osobám s vysokým tlakem a se srdečními problémy.


    Sérií sedmi dýchacích workshopů “Dýchám, tedy jsem” nás bude provázet Martin
    Podařil (www.uciteldechu.cz). Absolvent Fakulty tělesné výchovy a sportu
    Univerzity Karlovy (2012) se zkušenostmi s Holotropním dýcháním, Maitri
    dýcháním, Vědomým dýcháním, Phoenix breathwork, Santa Maria breathwork,
    Activating breathwork, Wim Hof Method, Pranayamou a dalšími dechovými
    technikami a metodami.


    Cena za workshop:

    Předprodej - 300 Kč
    (https://donate.paralelnipolis.cz/events/351-3-workshop-dycham-tedy-jsem)

    Na místě - 350 Kč (krypto), 400 Kč (hotově)

    Přednáška volně navazuje na autorovu dřívější přednášku zabývající se
    základy kryptoměn. Připomene základní vlastnosti Bitcoinu a blockchainu
    zejména v technickém, ale i ekonomickém kontextu. Hlavním tématem jsou však
    alternativní decentralizované kryptoměny, se kterými seznámí posluchače
    prostřednictvím jejich technické klasifikace. Vybranými "altcoiny" se
    následně zabývá podrobněji. Posluchač se dozví, jak se liší některé
    populární z nich, jako např. Litecoin, Monero, Zerocash či Ethereum.


    Ing. Jan Skalický vystudoval výpočetní techniku na Elektrotechnické fakultě
    ČVUT. V současnosti pracuje jako SW architekt a lektor kurzů programování.
    Kromě pozic specialisty vývoje mikropočítačových systémů pracoval i v
    jaderné elektrárně Temelín. Je příznivcem rakouské ekonomické školy,
    klasického liberalismu a decentralizovaných systémů, mezi něž patří i
    Bitcoin a jiné kryptoměny. Je spoluautorem dvou knih na toto téma.

    Zveme vás na CryptoParty! Přednáška Pavla Luptáka o bezpečnosti šifrovaných
    messengerů je skvělou příležitostí potkat se a pobavit se nejen o tom, jak
    bezpečně šifrovat svoji komunikaci.


    CryptoParty je decentralizovaný koncept akcí, které se odehrávají po celém
    světě a zaměřují se na témata digitální bezpečnosti. Jsou skvělou
    příležitost pro networking s dalšími členy komunity, kteří používají stejné
    šifrované nástroje. Zveme všechny členy komunity, kteří chtějí nabrat nové
    kontakty a rovnou si ověřit bezpečnostní kódy komunikace.


    Vstup na párty je zdarma. Budeme se bavit o bezpečnosti a o tom, jak lépe
    chránit své soukromí. Těšíme se na vás!

    Nejvyšší čas pro zabezpečení vašeho telefonu!


    Bezpečná a šifrovaná komunikace je základem soukromí jednotlivce. V
    digitálním světě představuje obrovskou výzvu. Neustále čelí hrozbám zneužití
    a útoků.

    Soukromí je podmínkou svobodné společnosti. Většina lidí považuje své
    digitální konverzace za soukromé přesto, že používají nezabezpečené aplikace
    s přístupem třetích stran.

    WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Viber a další služby využíváme
    každodenně. Jsou však díky nim naše konverzace skutečně v bezpečí?


    Jak bezpečné jsou šifrované nástroje na komunikaci? Jak si maximálně
    zabezpečit svůj smartphone? Dokázala policie opravdu prolomit Threemu? Na
    tohle všechno odpoví a svět bezpečné komunikace vám přiblíží Pavol Luptak -
    etický hacker stojící za bezpečnostní firmou Nethemba a spoluzakladatel
    Paralelní Polis.

    Věděli jste, že výroba jednoho bavlněného trička vyžaduje cca 2700 litrů
    vody, což je ekvivalent více než dvou let spotřeby pitné vody jednoho
    člověka?

    Množství nových zakoupených oděvů se od šedesátých let ztrojnásobilo a svět
    jako celek každoročně spotřebuje více než 80 miliard kusů oblečení. Tato
    obrovská spotřeba přináší hromadění velkého množství odpadu.


    Především ale módní průmysl produkuje 8-10 % všech skleníkových emisí
    lidstva, což je více než letecký a námořní průmysl dohromady. Je druhým
    největším spotřebitelem vody na světě a oblečení z umělých vláken znečišťuje
    oceány uvolňováním velkého množství mikroplastů.


    O ekologických náhradách konvenčních látek se mluví již dlouhou dobu, kde
    ale ve vývoji tato technologie je? A opravdu přinese kýženou úlevu, nebo z
    ní vyvstanou jiné environmentální problémy? Co nám mohou přinést pokročilé
    biotechnologie? A jak se vlastně postavit směrem k módě udržitelným
    způsobem?


    Pojďme se společně s odborníky bavit o reálném dopadu produkce a hromadění
    oděvních materiálů na životní prostředí a pojďme hledat jejich zelené
    alternativy.

    RadicalxChange (RxC) aims to incrementally build a clear, coherent, and
    sustainable alternative to capitalism that embraces markets, egalitarianism,
    community, and decentralization. While free markets and liberal democracies
    delivered unprecedented benefits to humanity, they are also increasingly
    blamed for growing inequality, secular stagnation and political
    polarization. Radical Markets propose that thoughtful extension of market
    mechanisms into new areas can instead lead to greater equality, prosperity,
    and cooperation.


    These ambitious goals are underpinned by theoretical advances in political
    economics, mechanism design and game theory. The main ideas are based on
    questioning core tenets of current systems such as private property and "one
    person: one vote" elections.


    In this meeting, we will introduce the main concepts of Radical Markets:
    Quadratic Voting, Quadratic Funding and Common Ownership Self-Assessed Tax.
    We will discuss how these mechanisms can improve social decision making and
    funding of public goods. We will also highlight the meeting points between
    RxC, blockchain and open source communities.


    Speaker: Róbert Šuhada - is leading a machine learning team in the
    distributed energy generation sector. He studied Astrophysics at Max Planck
    Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Munich. His main interest are AI
    safety and policy, and social impact of new technologies (including social
    technologies such as RxC).

    Copenhagen Underground & Paralelni Polis presents a showcase of the best
    DIY/truly independent films from around the world with all of the proceeds
    from the screening going to support an amazing cause. The films come from
    the "Best of Fest" program from the 2019 Copenhagen Underground Film
    Festival and features short fiction, documentary and experimental films from
    around the world that were made with under 1,000 Euros. With no submission
    fees attached with the festival's submissions, every filmmaker from around
    the world is able to present their work, regardless of their own economic
    circumstances. The doors to the event open at 19:30 and the film screening
    will begin at 20:00. The entry is donation based with all of the funds going
    to support the Lumen Union.


    The Lumen Union is a direct initiative started by Copenhagen Underground
    which will take donations from events which will directly support the Lumen
    Union and use those funds to purchase brand new projectors, gaming consoles
    and speakers for refugee camps in different parts of the world in an effort
    to create safe cinematic and entertainment spaces for children as well as
    adults. The first organization which the Lumen Union will collaborate with
    is Salam LADC and the goal is to deliver a new Epson Projector, PS4, FIFA 20
    and speakers to a community center they operate in Bekaa Valley, Lebanon
    which supports over 4,400 refugees in the surrounding area.


    DOORS - 19:30

    FILMS - 20:00

    END - 21:30


    Entry - Donation Based


    Chris Chalkan: Dirty Rotten Liars, England, 8:00

    A hectic short about a dysfunctional support group of dysfunctional
    pathological liars which all gets fairly out of hand quickly as its
    delusional stakes are raised with a great uncertainty


    Curtis Essel: Sodom And Gomorah, Ghana/England, 9:44

    An intimate documentary which serves as a deep video portrait of the
    residents of Jamestown where corruption, prostitution, and violence have
    shaped the lives of the people and the hope which lies outside of this life


    Martin Sofiedal: The Wrong Guy, Norway, 5:32

    A brilliant dark comedy taking place in the desert of Los Angeles, an
    assassin struggling to pay rent with ambitions to make it in the city, takes
    a man hostage on a job who he soon finds out is a potentially valuable
    contact


    Rafiqfuad Yarahmadi: Evan: A Survivor’s Story, Kurdistan/Iraq, 18:50

    After fleeing Kurdistan from ISIS as a journalist covering the Peshmarga
    front lines, this documentary (created and also directed by his translator)
    shows the difficulties of today’s asylum seeking process and the stress it
    bears on families who are kept apart by borders and unjust immigration
    practices


    Shafiur Rahman: Rohingya Testimony: No Reason To Hide Our Faces,
    Bangladesh/England, 9:58

    A series of testimonies from young Rohingya girls and women who were
    sexually assaulted, raped, and brutalized, alongside their families,
    systematically by the Burmese state as part of its military operation to
    remove the Rohingya (an ethnic minority native to the area) from the Rakhine
    state.


    Mike: The Deb-t, USA, 4:01

    The worst film ever made. Pretty much like The Room, but a short film.


    Jasmin Luu: Different Directions, Germany, 5:05

    A magnificently executed choreographed dancing short which was
    joint-favorite at the 1st Copenhagen Underground Film Festival.


    Riccardo Cuorleggero: Sea Bream a l'Orange, Italy, 5:21

    The fan favorite of this year's Copenhagen Underground Film Festival, a dark
    comedy about a stoic musician who wishes to practice alone and in peace, and
    his annoying and persistent neighbor who continues to pester the man for a
    strange reason."

    Hoří bush v Austrálii, savany i pralesy v Africe a Jižní Americe! Hoří
    Sibiř, Indonésie i Evropa. Někde hoří více, někde méně. V médiích se
    objevují informace o miliardě živočichů, které pohltily australské požáry.
    Lidé přispívají na popálené koaly a na spálené amazonské pralesy. Afrika
    zatím netáhne, přestože v ní hoří nejvíc.


    Je požár něco, čeho se máme bát, nebo za něj naopak máme být rádi? Kde
    pomáhá a kde naopak působí největší škody? Šíří se oheň v přírodě samovolně,
    nebo jde o lidský záměr a z jakého důvodu? Přijďte si v tom udělat jasno a
    diskutovat se třemi odborníky na oheň v přírodě. Jejich jména zveřejníme již
    brzy.


    POZOR - meetup je placený a počet vstupenek je omezen! Vstupenku v hodnotě
    100,- si můžete koupit některým z následujících způsobů:

    Centralizace vs. decentralizace rozhodování o nakládání s výrobními faktory.
    Aplikace a kritické zhodnocení několika známých ekonomických teorií pomůže

    proč má stále řadu příznivců.

    Hackování je experimentální přístup k životu. V čem se liší od vědy,
    případně jiných přístupů ke změně? Jak souvisí věda, podnikání a hacking?
    Jak sa dá hackovat tělo a jak můžeme některé z principů hackingu použít v
    případě kryptoměn?


    Juraj vydal před pár týdny knihu Hackni sa, která se zabývá čtyřmi oblastmi:
    podnikáním, svobodou, hackingem a kryptoměnami. Přednáška bude úvodem k
    tomuto tématu s následnou diskuzí. Knížku si u nás v Paralelní Polis také
    budete moct zakoupit.


    Juraj je hacker a podnikatel. Založil několik firem a neziskovek. Momentálně
    se věnuje Bratislavské Paralelnej Polis. Hacking ho zajímá odmalička. Cílem
    jeho knihy - Hackni sa, je přiblížit lidem způsob myšlení hackerů bez toho,
    aniž by museli ovládat jednotlivé technologie, které IT hackeři používají na
    hledání bezpečnostních zranitelností.

    Lidská populace stále rychle roste. Na Zemi už není moc míst, kde by nebyl
    vidět zásah člověka. Přírodu kolem nás měníme k nepoznání. Klimatické změny,
    ztráta druhové rozmanitosti, vysychání, to vše může v konečném důsledku vést
    k drastickému snižování naší životní úrovně, anebo se můžeme mít v důsledku
    i lépe?


    Kam necháme stávající vývoj dojít? Stihneme se opět přizpůsobit novým
    podmínkám, ať už si je vytváříme sami nebo jsou výsledkem přirozených
    procesů? Jak chceme, aby vypadalo prostředí, ve kterém žijeme v brzké
    budoucnosti? Jak by se mělo změnit nastavení a principy, na kterých stojí
    lidská společnost, abychom se nemuseli bát o naší budoucnost? Přijďte
    diskutovat o budoucnosti lidstva s vědci z přírodovědných a humanitních
    oborů.

    Úspěch se rovná 1 % nápadu a 99 % schopností nápad realizovat.


    Obyčejně jde realizace projektu bez zbytečných problémů, pokud existuje
    jasný plán a každý v týmu ví, jaká je jeho role. Přesto se neustále opakují
    stejné realizační problémy. Proč nejsme schopni dotáhnout, co si
    naplánujeme? Proč některé projekty vyhnijí nebo zaniknou mnohem dříve než
    musejí? A proč jiné ani nezačnou, i když jsou pro nás důležité?


    Přesně na tyto otázky budeme hledat odpovědi v rámci workshopu v našem Paper
    Hubu!


    Proč vlastně přijít?

    Naučíme vás klíčové realizační disciplíny, díky kterým zvládnete efektivněji
    plánovat své úkoly jak pro sebe, tak pro tým, který s vámi spolupracuje.
    Navíc poznáte nové lidi řešící podobné situace. :-)

    Workshop je vhodný zejména pro manažery středně velkých týmů a firem. Své si
    v něm ale jistě najdou i ti, kteří s podnikáním teprve začínají a chtějí ho
    posunout o level výš.


    Akce je zdarma a je otevřena všem zájemcům ze široké veřejnosti. Kapacita je
    ale omezená. Aby na vás zbylo místo, je třeba si ho zamluvit předem na
    e-mailu: pavel@krepelka.coach.

    českých dějin a Co se stane, když se zhasne?


    Tomáš Cikrt, bývalý novinář a mluvčí ministerstva zdravotnictví, je od roku
    2014 šéfredaktorem online serveru Zdravotnický deník. Také vydal publikace -

    Zajímáte se o kryptoměny? Máte chuť se navzájem potkávat a sdílet své
    zkušenosti? Chcete diskutovat o aktuálním dění ve světě kryptoměn?

    Paralelní Polis si pro vás ve spolupráci s Pavel Přecechtěl a Petr Sanetrník
    připravili pravidelnou akci - Crypto snídaně!


    Tentokrát budeme řešit, zda je Bitcoin měnou budoucnosti. Zaměříme se na
    využití Bitcoinu a zda nás v budoucnu čeká většinová adopce kryptoměn. Je
    Bitcoin měnou budoucnosti nebo již současnosti? To a více budeme probírat
    22. 1. 2020!


    Naše pozvání přijal Petr Mára, technologický evangelista, youtuber,
    certifikovaný trenér Applu a zapálený fanoušek Bitcoinu.


    Můžete se samozřejmě těšit i na pořádnou snídani! :-)

    V přednášce se zaměříme na svět, kde Airbnb oživuje mrtvý kapitál a
    konkuruje státu v tvorbě regulací. Kde Kickstarter nahrazuje vybírání daní a
    pomáhá financovat veřejné služby, a kde Bitcoin umožňuje budovat paralelní
    společnost, v které neexistují „vůdci".


    Pokrok, který přináší internet nekonkuruje jen analogovým podnikatelům a
    kamenným obchodům, ale především světu zákonů, úředníků a politiky. A právě
    to je tématem přednášky - střet digitálních technologií 21.st. se světem
    kamenných institucí z dob 20.st.


    Robert Chovanculiak absolvoval doktorské studium na Ekonomické fakultě UMB v

    veřejného sektoru, internetovým technologiím a školství. Je autorem stovek

    Antibiotika, pilulka anebo bylinný výluh? Jakou možnost volíte vy? Naše
    pozvání přijal šaman pro 21. století Dalibor Chytil, který nám poví, jak nám
    byliny můžou pomoct s únavou.


    Co vše může být za „obyčejnou“ únavou a jak ji komplexně řešit? Proč je
    někdy lepší nahradit kávu čajem? Které bylinky dokáží únavu dlouhodobě
    řešit? Toho všeho se budeme dotýkat na této přednášce. Navíc bude doplněná o
    ochutnávku různých druhů čaje.


    Dalibor je fytoterapeut neboli bylinář. Vystudoval chemii, aby mohl
    propojovat světy západní a východní medicíny. K řešení zdravotních problémů
    svých klientů využívá byliny, a to v různých formách – bylinné směsi,
    tinktury, extrakty nebo oleje. Je autorem projektu Cityshaman, tedy šaman
    21. století.


    Vstupné stojí 250,- a najdete v něm také ochutnávku různých druhů čaje.

    Zveme Vás na seminář „Úzkost, deprese a sebevražda“, v němž se budete moci
    detailně seznámit s psychickými i fyzickými projevy úzkostí a depresí, jimiž
    v ČR trpí více než milion obyvatel. Až polovina z nich se přitom neléčí.
    Dozvíte se také více o projevech sebevražedného chování, ale také o
    možnostech léčby úzkostí a depresí, které nabízí současná psychiatrie.


    Komu je seminář určen? Primárně těm, kdo pracují pod velkým tlakem nebo v
    sociální izolaci, pociťují přitom napětí, nervozitu i řadu nepříjemných
    fyzických příznaků, které nemají podklad v žádném tělesném onemocnění. Dále
    je seminář určen všem, kteří hledají cestu k pochopení jednání i potřeb
    členů rodiny a přátel trpících depresí, nebo některou z úzkostných poruch
    (panická porucha, agorafobie, sociální fobie, specifické fobie, obsedantně
    kompulzivní porucha, posttraumatická stresová porucha). Seminář vás také
    vybaví základními dovednostmi v oblasti poskytování laické první pomoci
    lidem v úzkosti a depresi. A konečně, v rámci semináře se dozvíte více o
    základech duševní hygieny, které můžete vcelku snadno zařadit do svého
    běžného života, abyste tak zlepšili jeho kvalitu.


    Kdo seminář povede? Publicista Jeroným Janíček. Autor dokumentárního cyklu
    Život za zdí (www.youtube.com/zivotzazdi), oceněný Novinářskou cenou
    Psychiatrické společnosti České lékařské společnosti JEP. Působí v pražském
    Radiu 1 a je autorem mnoha textů o úzkostech, desítkách rozhovorů s předními
    českými psychiatry a psychology, ale také s lékaři urgentní medicíny,
    neurologie a interny. Jeroným Janíček má také osobní zkušenost s jednou
    úzkostných poruch, depresí i léčbou na psychiatrii.

    14:00 - 16:30 - Blok I.

    Stresová reakce (vznik, průběh)

    16:30 - 17:00 - Občerstvení

    Stále někoho hlídat, kontrolovat a upomínat? Takhle se práce dělat nedá.

    Chcete to změnit? Pak je třeba začít trošku jinde. Třeba sestavováním týmu z
    těch “nejvhodnějších” a ne těch “nejlepších”.


    Jenže jak na to? Jak začít budovat opravdovou kulturu zodpovědnosti, kde
    platí, co se dohodne a každý z týmu převezme otěže za dohody, které uzavírá?


    Přesně na tyto otázky budeme hledat odpovědi na workshopu v našem Paper
    Hubu.


    Proč vlastně přijít?

    Povíme vám, proč kontrola není 100% nástroj. Ukážeme vám principy, na
    kterých byste měli začít stavět svůj tým a na čem si zakládat zejména.
    Naučíme vás budovat kulturu zodpovědnosti ve vašem týmu a v neposlední řadě
    potkáte nové lidi řešící podobné situace. :-)


    Akce je zdarma a je otevřena všem zájemcům ze široké veřejnosti. Kapacita je
    ale omezená. Chyťte si předem místo na e-mailu: pavel@krepelka.coach.

    Hacker Stories jsou tu zas! Tentokrát se zaměříme na hackování bank. Lidé
    dávají bankám naprostou důvěru a nechávají v nich většinu svého majetku.
    Víte, jak jsou vaše peníze v bance zabezpečené?👀


    Podíváme se na případy hackerů, kteří stáli za úspěšnými útoky na bankovní
    systémy a obohatili se tak o nemalé částky. Přiblížíme si jejich příběhy,
    postupy a také to, jakým způsobem byli odhaleni a dopadeni.


    Může se stát hackování bankomatů, o kterém sní Hollywood už desítky let,
    skutečností? Uvedeme vás do příběhů hackování bank, bankomatů a krádeží
    karet. Magnát, který krade bankovní karty z celého světa, pak je prodává na
    darknetu a žádná tajná služba ho nedokáže zatknout? I tohle se děje.

    Temná stránka digitálního světa skrývá mnoho fascinujících příběhů, které
    jsou nejen napínavé, ale mohou nás také hodně naučit o digitální bezpečnosti
    a světě kolem nás.


    Přednášku povede Mário Havel, nadšenec kryptotechnologií a digitální
    bezpečnosti, člen Paralelní Polis a předseda Slovak Students for Liberty.


    Hacker Stories je série přednášek, která zkoumá temná zákoutí internetu.
    Příběhy o hackerech, únicích dat, soukromí a hrozbách dnešního internetu.
    Jsou určené širokému publiku, takže si nevyžadují specializované znalosti.
    Naopak, zaměříme se v nich na známe hacky, které měly dopad na celou
    společnost. Budeme se taky bavit o tom, proč a jak jednotliví hackeři
    jednali, ale taky si prakticky ukážeme, jak se útokům můžeme bránit.

    Zajímáte se o kryptoměny? Máte chuť se navzájem potkávat a sdílet své
    zkušenosti? Chcete diskutovat o aktuálním dění ve světě kryptoměn?

    Paralelní Polis si pro vás ve spolupráci s Pavel Přecechtěl a Petr Sanetrník
    připravili pravidelnou akci - Crypto snídaně!


    Tentokorát budeme řešit Kryptoekonomiku v praxi. Probereme, jak kryptoměny
    celkovou ekonomiku mění a také, jak mění přístup lidí k penězům a hodnotě.
    Podíváme se na to, jak daleko nebo na začátku stojíme a zda se Bitcoin
    jednou může stát celosvetově uznávanou měnou.


    Naše pozvání přijal Mgr. Ing. Dominik Stroukal, Ph.D.

    Dominik je hlavní ekonom finanční skupiny Roklen, vyučuje na VŠ CEVRO
    institut, provází pořadem Kdo to platí? na MALL.TV, je také šéfredaktorem
    časopisu Trade-off, vede společnost bit agency a je autorem několika knih.


    Můžete se samozřejmě těšit i na pořádnou snídani! :-)

    In Paralelní Polis we also love sound and music! We would like to build a
    community of people who have the same passion to share it with us. And we
    decided we want to start from scratch.


    We invite you for overview and introduction into electronic music production
    which is suitable for anyone at beginner level whether you have started
    producing already or are completely new to the practice. We will cover
    subjects such as different electronic music genres, equipment and theory. We
    will be using Ableton Live 10 so please feel free to bring your laptops
    along if you have the software already. We will take a look at how to
    navigate the software and some fundamental music production techniques so
    you have the skills to start creating your own tracks!


    Workshop will be led by Adam Russell. He is a DJ & Producer from Manchester
    UK. Taking a keen interest in mixing on the decks and the organic
    underground sounds of house/techno he decided to pursue a three year degree
    in Electronic Music Production and DJ Practices. With some of today’s best
    electronic music being made in a bedroom or home studio he is now
    collaborating with producers to fine tune their production skills, sharing
    new ideas and helping them to discover their unique sound.

    Environmentální hnutí nabývají zejména v západním světě na nebývalé síle.
    Protesty za záchranu klimatu, biodiverzity, volání po okamžitých opatřeních
    ke snížení ekologické stopy. Do toho přibývají reakce států, samospráv a
    korporací, které se předhánějí v příslibech ekologizačních opatření. Podaří
    se tento trend udržet při zachování svobodné společnosti? Nebo už se dávno
    řítíme do nového totalitního řádu, založeného na ideologii záchrany planety
    před environmentální katastrofou, které bude potřeba podřídit úplně všechno?
    Paralelní Polis otevírá diskuzi na toto naléhavé téma!


    Není to přitom náhoda - letošním nejvýznamnějším “totalitním” výročím je
    bezesporu 30 let od 17. 11. 1989. Připomínkové akce odkazují nepříznivé
    poměry období totalitního státu postaveného na marx-leninské ideologii mezi
    lety 1948 - 1989 a okolnosti jeho zániku. Část z nich varuje před nástupem
    autoritářských pořádků z pozic ekonomických oligarchů. Jsou to ale opravdu
    jediné hrozby nových totalit v našich poměrech?


    Odpověď na tuto otázku nikdo z nás nezná. Z minulosti se však můžeme v jedné
    věci poučit - vyplatí se hledat odpovědi v seriózní kritické diskuzi. Proto
    na meetup pozveme historika, politologa a znalce environmentálního hnutí, se
    kterými bude moci na uvedené téma otevřeně diskutovat. Jména konkrétních
    řečníků brzy zveřejníme.


    POZOR - meetup je placený a počet vstupenek je omezen! Navíc máme dvojí
    vstupné. Jedno základní a druhé s občerstvením. Vstupenku si můžete koupit
    některým z následujících způsobů:

    Slovo biohacking se stále častěji objevuje v médiích a na sociálních sítích.
    Biohackers mají svůj originální přístup, kombinují různé metody a
    technologie, které mohou zlepšit náš každodenní život. Ale může být
    biohacking také nebezpečný?


    Kolik času věnuje biohacker měření svého těla? A jak pracuje s daty, které
    získá? Biohacking není pouze ráj, zaslíbený stav těla a mysli, ale také
    tvrdá práce a dřina, kterou musí člověk podstoupit, pokud chce změnit svůj
    život a životní styl.


    Co se skrývá za slovním spojením digitální šamanismus? Se slovem šamanismus
    se potkáváme v poslední době stále častěji. Jak spolu souvisí biohacking a
    šamanismus? Co mají společné a jak je můžeme prakticky využívat v
    každodenním životě?


    Naše pozvání přijal Filip Říha a jeho žena Kateřina Andělová. Filip má za
    sebou více než 10 let zkušeností se změnami životního stylu, těla a vědomí.
    Filip je kouč a mentor, který zásadně změnil svůj život. Po studiu v
    zahraničí pracoval pro mezinárodní poradenskou firmu. V tomto stylu života
    ale nenašel, co hledal a díky půstu v izraelské poušti se vydal na novou
    cestu. Teď kombinuje raw food, přirozený pohyb, běhání naboso, jógu,
    meditaci a primárně vědomý životní styl. Kateřinu na její cestě k rozvoji
    vědomí a zdravému životnímu stylu nasměrovaly její těžké nemoci, ze kterých
    se intenzivní prací sama na sobě uzdravila. Díky tomu nasbírala velké
    množství inspirace, kterou skrze svou tvorbu šíří dál. Píše knihy, pořádá
    semináře, připravuje divadelní hru a věnuje se osobnímu poradenství a
    koučinku.


    Můžete se těšit na tipy i ukázky toho, co funguje Filipovi a Kateřině a
    hlavně povídání o tom, co je to vědomý životní styl, co si vůbec vzít z
    biohackingu a kde jinde hledat inspiraci pro život. Přijďte! Těšíme se!!

    Ve spolupráci s Nadačním fondem nezávislé žurnalistiky jsme pro vás
    připravili první novinářské mikrofórum. Cílem této nové akce je představovat
    zajímavé projekty kombinující novinářskou praxi a využívání nejmodernějších
    technologií. Celou sérií vás bude provázet Josef Šlerka, ředitel NFNŽ a
    odborník na analýzu dat ze sociálních sítí.


    V rámci prvního takového setkání Vám představíme tyto projekty:


    Josef Šlerka: Co přivezli do Hamburku

    Josef se ohlédne za nejzajímavějšími projekty prezentovanými na Global
    Investigative Journalism Conference 2019 v Hamburku. Také pohovoří o
    získávání dat ze včelích úlů, jak najít koncentrační tábory v Číně nebo jak
    využívat grafové databáze ve Financial Times.


    Jan Cibulka: “Sensor Journalism” v České republice

    Jan promluví o tom, jak se dělá novinařina zaměřená na získávání dat pomocí
    senzorů a přidá také pár novinek o aktuálních projektech, na kterých pracují
    v redakci iRozhlas.cz.


    Pavla Holcová, Pavol Lupták: “Ako sme „hackli“ eKasu: podvádzať na daniach
    nikdy nebolo jednoduchšie.”

    Příběh o tom, jak se podařilo hacknout eKasu na Slovensku i o tom, jak
    funguje spolupráce novinářů a programátorů společně poví Pavla Holcová,
    investigativní novinářka, zakladatelka serveru investigace.cz a etický
    hacker Pavol Lupták, CEO Nethemba s.r.o.


    Novinářské mikrofórum Hackováním za lepší novinařinu je součástí nového
    projektu Media Hub Paralelní Polis, který je zaměřený na podporu nezávislé
    novinářské praxe v Česku. Cílem je vytvořit platformu pro sdílení zkušeností
    a šíření vědomostí formou co-workingového prostoru a vzdělávacích aktivit.

    Jestli dnes něco spojuje všechny bez rozdílu věku, pohlaví či politických
    názorů, jsou to memes!


    Na jednom pivu jsme dostali nápad, znáte to... pobavit se o memes trochu
    jinak. Diskutovat o nich nejen jako o způsobu, jímž trávíme čas, ale také o
    tom, jak ovlivňují naše schopnosti pozorovat, napodobovat, sdílet a v
    neposlední řadě uvědomit si, že žijeme ve společnosti.


    První večer Meme Meetupu představí vyhaslou internetovou ikonu Lukáše
    Vychopeně a memologa a znalce českého fotbalu - Vojtěcha Lukavce. Ti nám na
    svých oblíbených meme momentech představí jejich pohled na tento
    společensko-kulturní fenomén v českém kontextu.


    Budeme se těšit!

    Pro příklady různých energetických trendů a jejich výsledků nemusíme chodit
    daleko. ČR v posledních 50 letech zažila přinejmenším tři:


    ► období takřka výlučné kombinace tepelných a vodních elektráren

    ► výstavbu jaderných elektráren

    ► významnou státní podporu obnovitelných zdrojů


    Společně se budeme bavit s odborníky, jak zdejší energetický mix vypadá a
    proč tomu tak je. Jaké technologie získávání energie máme k dispozici a jaká
    rizika jsou s nimi spojena.


    Elektrická energie je nejen zásadním enviro. fenoménem, je hlavně
    univerzálním zdrojem uspokojení stále většího okruhu lidských potřeb.

    Žárovka, elektromotor, mikročip, baterie, atd. zásadním způsobem ovlivnily
    podobu naší planety a společnosti a vývoj tímto směrem stále nabírá na
    obrátkách. Míra lidského blahobytu se stává čím dál více závislá na
    dostatečném přísunu el. energie. A to pokud možno kdekoliv na světě.


    Na jednu stranu se můžeme radovat, že už nemusíme nutně spoléhat na přímou
    konzumaci fosilních paliv a můžeme elektrickou energii získávat z
    obnovitelných zdrojů. Využívání těchto zdrojů však stále čelí mnoha
    překážkám – zabírá spoustu místa, ruší krajinný ráz, či nedokáže spolehlivě
    a stabilně nasytit stále rostoucí spotřebu. Využívání fosilních paliv a
    jaderné energie zajišťuje stabilní vysokou a snadno škálovatelnou produkci,
    avšak za cenu a rizika, které už dnes možná nejsme ochotni přijmout.


    Poprvé na Enviro Meetup otevíráme otázku energetiky, těšíme se na vaši účast
    a podněty, které z diskuze vyplynou!

    Máme pro vás praktický workshop o pohybové hygieně.🤸‍♂️

    Tvoří ji určité návyky, které při pravidelném opakování a zařazení do denní
    rutiny dokáží zlepšit a obohatit život.


    Vyzkoušíme si jednoduchý check, kterým zjistíme, jak jsme na tom s
    rovnováhou a trochu se popereme s gravitací. Povíme si o základních
    principech udržování svého těla fit a bez bolestí v dlouhodobém měřítku,
    nebo jak můžeme např. při čištění zubů pracovat na odstraňování dysbalancí.


    Praktickým workshopem Vás provede Robin Viktora, který v roce 2014 společně
    s Jirkou Smigou založil skupinu Dark Side Movement, jejíž tělocvična je v
    Brně. Zde také vytváří komunitu lidí bavící se cvičením a vede skupinové
    lekce síly a mobility. Lekce jsou přizpůsobené jak pro sportovce, tak pro
    lidi se sedavým zaměstnáním.

    Připravte se na přednášku o nahých fotkách. Nejcitlivější osobní údaje,
    které většina lidí nosí s sebou v kapse. Máte je v telefonu taky?

    Co se může stát, pokud je pošlete pomstychtivému příteli? Co asi udělá
    hacker, který o nich ví a chce je získat? Jak se před pár lety dostali
    útočníci ke stovkám nahých fotografií světových celebrit?


    V rámci přednášky si povíme o historii tzv. revenge porn = obchodování s
    ukradenými nahými fotkami. Hlavně vám ale ukážeme, jak se takové nepříjemné
    krádeži bránit.

    Přednášku povede Mário Havel, člen Paralelní Polis a předseda Slovak
    Students for Liberty.


    Hacker Stories je série přednášek zkoumající temná internetová zákoutí - o
    hackerech, únicích dat, soukromí a dalších hrozbách dnešního internetu. Jsou
    určeny širokému publiku, takže nevyžadují specializované znalosti. Zajímají
    vás známé hacky, jež měly dopad na celou společnost? Proč a jak jednotliví
    hackeři jednali? Pak jsou přednášky přesně pro vás. Mimo tyto zajímavosti si
    také prakticky ukážeme, jak se útokům můžeme bránit.

    Jak funguje současný finanční systém a může mu být Bitcoin alternativou?

    V rámci své přednášky se Lucie Komárková zaměří na minulost a současnost
    Bitcoinu. Bude mluvit o jeho vzniku a technologických aspektech jeho
    fungování, a také o momentální ekonomice.


    Lucie je členkou Paralelní Polis a Students for Liberty. Věnuje se
    talebovskému pohledu na svět, decentralizovaným systémům a exponencionálním
    technologiím v čele s Bitcoinem, o kterém společně s rakouskou ekonomií
    přednáší.

    Existují různé alternativní modely vzdělávání? Kde všude se můžeme vzdělávat
    a jak?


    Michal Kandler, člen Svobody Učení, v rámci své přednášky vysvětlí, proč
    není možná opravdová reforma uvnitř existujícího tradičního systému
    vzdělávání. Zároveň představí koncept sebeřízeného vzdělávání a jeho
    jednotlivé formy - od deschoolingu, až po worldschooling.

    Po přednášce bude panelová diskuse s konkrétními zástupci z řad studentů a
    rodičů, kteří se rozhodli převzít zodpovědnost za svoje vzdělávání a
    vzdělávání svých dětí.

    Projekce dokumentárního filmu režiséra Martina Marečka zachycuje úskalí
    rozvojové pomoci Africe. Po skončení projekce budete mít navíc možnost
    diskutovat nejen se samotným režisérem filmu, ale i s hlavními hrdiny
    příběhu.


    Film na příběhu dvou českých expertů v zambijské osadě Masuku, kterou
    elektrifikovali solárními panely, naprosto otevřeně sleduje úskalí rozvojové
    pomoci. Je příběhem pokusu předání evropské technologie a odpovědnosti, ale
    i „zlatých českých ručiček“, které si dokáží poradit i uprostřed Afriky.


    Projekci navštíví spolu s režisérem Martinem Marečkou i ekolog a odborník na
    obnovitelné zdroje Milan Smrž a Tomáš Tožička, odborník na regionální
    rozvoj.


    Vstupné činí 150 Kč a můžete si ho zakoupit osobně v naší kavárně v den
    promítání, kde vám barista s nákupem poradí a pomůže.

    We invited Steve Fau to talk to us about decentralised governance. He will
    present use case of how Ethfinex designed it's governance model and the
    challenges we had to overcome before evolving to DeversiFi.


    He will also talk about:

    - How Ethfinex found and operates DAO

    - Designing governance model to align with the business goals of
    decentralised exchange

    - Role of utility token in a DAO & is utility token really necessary?


    Steve Fau has a background in traditional finance and computer science.
    After conducting own research in the blockchain ecosystem from late 2016,
    Steve finally joined Ethfinex in 2018 as a project management intern. He was
    soon assigned a product manager role, overseeing the development of Ethfinex
    Trustless - a very unique hybrid decentralised exchange product. This DEX
    has rapidly evolved into a core product of newly launched venture,
    DeversiFi, where Steve currenly serves as head of product. He is currently
    focusing on the UX aspect of things to bring the DeFi world closer to the
    masses.

    Paralelní hydroponii v Bistru 8 se daří parádně a salátky s bazalkou budou
    za 14 dní připravené na první sklizeň!

    Sklizení první úrody je speciální zážitek a vždy je ve vzduchu napětí, jak
    úroda pěstovaná bez půdy bude vlastně chutnat.


    Všechny vás zveme! Chceme abyste u tohoto krásného momentu byli s námi.
    Bistro 8 připraví delikátní meníčko vytvořené výhradně ze sklizených salátků
    a bazalek, a vy tak máte jedinečnou možnost ochutnat.

    Kluci z Parallel Garden navíc promluví o podstatě jejich hydroponií, o
    zkušenostech s hydroponickým pěstováním a o jejich vizi do budoucna.

    Z Paralelní Polis dorazí produkční tým, který zařídí live stream a dosah pro
    další fanoušky mimo Prahu.


    Objevujte s námi nový fenomén soběstačnosti pěstování ve městech ;) Moc se
    na vás těšíme a budeme rádi, když vás přijde co nejvíc!

    Kde se vzal bitcoin a jak funguje? Proč jej vlastnit a co od něj očekávat v
    budoucnu? A kde ho pořídit a jaké má využití?


    Pozvání na další přednášku o kryptoměnách přijal dlouholetý bitcoin nadšenec
    a bloger Karel Fillner. Karel bude mluvit mimo jiné také o tom, proč je
    dobré uvažovat o bitcoinu ne jen jako o investiční příležitosti.

    Po přednášce bude prostor na vaše dotazy. Nově nabyté znalosti

    si navíc budete moci vyzkoušet v naší Bitcoin Coffee.

    Přednáška s projekcí dokumentu


    VEJDI VEN je série přednášek a diskuzí s cílem připravit a podpořit nový
    projekt Paralelní Polis s pracovním názvem CRYPTO TRUCK. Naším už čtvrtým
    hostem bude dobrodruch a ochránce slonů z Třince Arthur F. Sniegon.


    Arthur se po ukončení studia Ekologické a evoluční biologie na
    Přírodovědecké fakultě UK vydal zachraňovat slony do centrální Afriky.
    Většinu cesty absolvoval na kole a kajaku a tímto způsobem procestoval
    bezmála 6000 km těmi nejzapadlejšími oblastmi Kamerunu, Gabonu, Konga,
    Demokratického Konga, Středoafrické republiky a Čadu.


    V průběhu své cesty se začal aktivně zapojovat do vyšetřování ilegálního
    obchodu s volně žijícími živočichy. Aby poznal, zdokumentoval a následně
    změnil temnou realitu pytláctví slonů a ilegálního obchodu se slonovinu
    začal se osobně stýkat s lovci, pytláky a pašeráky, byl volavkou a jeho
    aktivity vedly až k zatčení několika překupníků. Ilegálním obchodem s volně
    žijícími zvířaty se Arthur zabývá stále a mimo jiné působí v afrických
    národních parcích, kde mapuje a popisuje sloní populaci.


    V rámci své přednášky nám Arthur představí a promítne svůj dokumentární
    film, který v Africe natočil, poví nám více o své expedici, a promluví o
    tom, co v současné době v rámci boje s ilegálním obchodem s volně žijícími
    zvířaty podniká.


    Vstup na akci dobrovolný. Avšak zakoupením rezervace, přispíváte ke
    kvalitními programu v Paralelní Polis. Akce začne v 18:30 neformálním
    posezením v naší kavárně, kde představíme projekt Crypto Trucku. Samotná
    přednáška pak začne od 19:00.

    Zveme Vás na druhý ze tří workshopů, ve kterých si osvojíte základy
    programování WebAssembly v jazyce Rust. Workshop je určen pro začátečníky či
    zájemce o programování v jazyce Rust, kteří by rádi nahlédli do zákulisí
    tvorby jednoduché WASM aplikace - interaktivní variace na Conwayovu hru
    "Life".


    Workshop povede Jakub Lanc a čeká vás:


    - příprava potřebných komponentů

    - základy wasm-bindgen - rozhraní mezi JavaScriptem a WASM moduly

    - kompilace a spuštění elementárního WASM modulu ("Hello, Rust&WASM!") v
    prohlížeči

    - experimentování s Rust kódem - stavební kameny "Life" aplikace


    Workshop bude koncipován v praktické rovině. Měli byste mít základní
    znalosti programování (ideálně ve staticky typovaných jazycích) a základy
    JavaScriptu. Příklady budou demonstrovány v prostředí Windows 10, ale
    instalační a další kroky by měly být podobné i pro ostatní OS. Můžete přijít
    i přesto, že jste na prvním workshopu nebyli.


    Těšíme se na vás!

    Design meetup je nová série přednášek zaměřená na různé podoby designu ve
    vztahu k digitálním technologiím. Zaměříme se na zkoumání různých metod,
    trendů a designových řešení. V rámci prvního setkání jsme pozvali grafickou
    designéru Lenka Hámošovou a teoretika Lukáše Pilku.


    Lenka se v rámci své přednášky zaměří na to, jakým způsobem dokáže umělá
    inteligence generovat fotorealistické scenérie, objekty, zvířata nebo lidi,
    které nepochází z našeho fyzického světa. Jedna polovina internetu se baví
    face-swap filtrami, druhá se děsí zneužití deepfakes či už v politickém nebo
    osobním životě. Je nejvyšší čas na reset našeho vizuálního očekávání a
    nastartování procesu adaptace no novou post-truth realitu.


    Lukáš bude mluvit o tom, jak stroje vidí umění. Umělá inteligence dnes
    dokáže “vidět” a navigovat samořiditelná auta, identifikovat osoby nebo
    detekovat nevybuchlou munici. S jistotou rozpozná, jaké objekty jsou na
    fotografii, ale zvládne také odhalit malířský rukopis, výtvarný styl a
    přinést nový pohled na klasická i současná umělecká díla.


    Lukáš je kritik, publicista, doktorand na pražské UMPRUM a artdirector ve
    studiu BlueGhost. Zabývá se grafickým designem, současnými technologiemi a
    přesahy obojího do světa volného umění. Lenka je grafická designérka, kterou
    baví zkoumání reality kolem nás kritickým pohledem. Její design odhaluje to,
    co nám často zůstává skryté.


    Těšíme se na vás!

    Už několik let zažíváme v Česku nebývalá sucha. Zemědělcům klesá úroda a
    stoupají kompenzace. Smrky se s posledním vypětí sil snaží zanechat
    potomstvo. Hladina ve studnách klesá. Jsme na tyto rychlé změny připraveni?
    Uvědomujeme si je vůbec?


    Obnova lesů bližší k přirozenému stavu je díky suchu a přemnožené spárkaté
    zvěři čím dál obtížnější. Díky odvodňovacím melioracím jsme z velké části
    české krajiny udělali vyschlé stepi až polopouště. Narušili jsme malý vodní
    okruh, a ten velký nejspíš změnil směr i intenzitu.


    Přijďte diskutovat se třemi odborníky o tom, jak můžeme s vysycháním krajiny
    bojovat, jak v ní zadržet víc vody a znovu rozhýbat malý vodní cyklus. Naše
    řečníky brzy představíme.

    Paralelní Polis ve spolupráci s Crypviz a Investree připravili meetup
    zaměřený na komunitu lidí, kteří mají chuť se navzájem potkávat a diskutovat
    o aktuálním dění ve světě kryptoekonomiky. Crypto snídaně se pravidelně koná
    vždy první týden v měsíci. Pokaždé bude má své téma a zveme čestného hosta.

    Takže nejdříve si dáme něco dobrého a pak bude následovat diskuze na téma
    Bitcoin vs. Banky. Může fungovat propojení bank a kryptoměn? Je vůbec nutné
    propojovat tyto dva světy? Naše pozvání přijal Karel Fillner, který působí
    jako ředitel v krypto bankovní asociaci BACCA, s Bitcoinem má zkušenosti od
    roku 2012 a má svůj publikační web btctip.cz.


    Pokud Tě baví kryptoměny, decentralizace a dapp tak se stav! Začínáme v
    9:00. Můžeš se těšit na pořádný bufet v ceně: vajíčka se slaninou, sýry a
    quiche a samozřejmě nebude scházet výborná kávu. Vše pro nás s láskou
    připraví Bitcoin Coffee.


    Vstup, kterým pokrýváme náklady: 200 Kč - platba na místě v BTC/LTC nebo na
    našich stránkách

    Kryptoměny jsou zbytečně složité, špatně se s nimi pracuje a pro běžného
    smrtelníka jsou nepoužitelné a zbytečné. Nesmysl!


    Podle nás jsou hudbou budoucnosti! Stavte se v Paralelní Polis a promluvíme
    si o nejznámějších mýtech, které si lidi s touto měnou pojí. V rámci
    interaktivní přednášky Vám ukážeme, jak si kryptoměnu jako např. bitcoin
    můžete zakoupit, kde si ji můžete uložit a samozřejmě si taky vyzkoušíme
    platbu. Můžete si koupit naši skvělou kávu nebo nějaký dortík.


    Přednáškou Vás provede Jakub Souček, který Vám ukáže, že práce s
    kryptoměnami je úplně pro každého a neliší se od práce s klasickými penězi.


    Těšíme se na vás!

    Dokumentární film sleduje časosběrnou metodou příběhy tří dětí, které
    opustily „děcák“ a staví se na vlastní nohy. Hana Ludvíková a Hana
    Třeštíková sledovaly jejich cestu více jak čtyři roky. Měli stejnou
    startovní čáru, ale jejich cesty nabraly strmý a odlišný směr. Jak se sotva
    plnoletý člověk bez zkušenosti života v rodině dokáže zařadit do
    společnosti?


    Po promítání budeme diskutovat s


    Ing. Monika Červíčková, poslankyně Parlamentu ČR, členka Stálé komise pro
    rodinu, rovné příležitosti a národnostní menšiny

    Martin Lněnička, ředitel DD Dolní Počernice, 1. místopředseda Federace
    dětských domovů

    Ing. Dominika Šenková, manažerka pro Čechy integračního projektu Začni
    správně

    Mgr. et Bc. Michaela Škorníčková, metodik integračního projektu Začni
    správně


    Jaké jsou nejčastější překážky při a po odchodu z dětského domova?
    Doprovodná čí následná péče o mladé odcházející z DD je v České republice
    tristní a to se podepisuje i na počtu odcházejících mlaďochů, kteří neumějí
    hospodařit s penězi, takže se brzy zadluží a v nejhorší případech skončí na
    ulici, zatíženi exekucí, závislí na drogách či alkoholu. Obvykle nemají
    žádné fungující rodinné zázemí, do něhož se mohou vrátit. Hůře si shánějí
    práci i bydlení a bez řádné doprovodné péče končí na okraji společnosti či v
    dluhových pastech.

    VEJDI VEN je série přednášek a diskuzí s cílem připravit a podpořit nový
    projekt Paralelní Polis s pracovním názvem CRYPTO TRUCK. Našimi dalšími
    hosty budou duchovní otci projektu Tatra kolem světa 2 Petr Holeček a Marek
    Havlíček. Ti chtějí v únoru 2020 navázat na legendární českou expedici Tatra
    kolem světa, jenž v roce 1987 vyrazila kolem světa z tehdejší komunistické
    CSSR a vrátila se po 37 měsících v dubnu 1990 do popřevratové CSFR.


    Petr Holeček s jeho kolegou Markem Havlíčkem plánují převzít tuto pomyslnou
    pochodeň a vydat se, jak říkají, na zatím největší expedici kolem světa
    všech dob.


    V rámci přednášky se s námi Petr podělí nejen o své vychytávky a zkušeností
    v rámci příprav s cestou kolem světa, ale i o své příběhy a nezdary z cest
    předchozích.

    Vstup na akci dobrovolný. Avšak zakoupením rezervace, přispíváte ke
    kvalitními programu v Paralelní Polis. Akce začne v 18:30 neformálním

    Co se změnilo od první diskuze mezi studenty a vědci, která se konala na
    půdě pražské Paralelní Polis 9. dubna? Kam se studentské stávky za klima
    posunuly? Kdo další se snaží měnit mentalitu politiků? Britský parlament
    právě vyhlásil stav klimatické nouze. Studenti po celém světě vyšli v pátek
    3. května znovu do ulic. Podařilo se jim už něco prosadit?


    V minulé diskuzi jsme se soustředili nejvíce na získávání potřebné energie a
    tom zdali a jak rychle je nutný přechod na obnovitelné zdroje. Tentokrát
    bychom se raději věnovali tématům nám bližším, které navíc můžeme mnohem
    snáž ovlivňovat sami. A těmi jsou krajina, ve které žijeme, její využívání,
    druhová rozmanitost a schopnost měnit klima.


    Přijďte také diskutovat se zástupci studentské stávky Fridays For Future a
    vědci, kteří se klimatickými změnami dlouhodobě zabývají. Už po druhé! Naším
    cílem je opět zprostředkovat užší dialog mezi vědeckou a studentskou
    komunitou a hledat řešení společně.

    Přijďte s námi oslavit Pizza Bitcoin Day! 🍕🍕🍕

    Připomeneme si tak společně výročí nejdražší pizzy v historii...


    Před devíti lety si programátor Laszlo Hanyecz objednal dvě Papa John’s
    pizzy a zaplatil za ně neuvěřitelných 10 000 bitcoinů. Jednalo se totiž o
    první transakci, při které byly bitcoiny směněny za hmotnou věc. Transakce
    měla v té době hodnotu 41 dolarů, dnes by byla hodnota této transakce více
    než 55 milionů dolarů.


    Můžete se těšit na neformální diskuze o budoucnosti ne jen bitcoinu,
    příjemnou společnost, dobrou hudbu a samozřejmě výbornou pizzu.

    VEJDI VEN je série přednášek a diskuzí s cílem připravit a podpořit nový
    projekt Paralelní Polis s pracovním názvem CRYPTO TRUCK, jehož cílem bude
    vyrazit ze svého působiště - černého domu v Dělnické ulici v Praze - do
    světa. Po celý následující rok budeme postupně zvát různé osobnosti -
    cestovatele, humanitární pracovníky, ale i experty přes nejrůznější
    technologie, kteří nám poví o svých zkušenostech a vědomostech, abychom se
    co nejlépe připravili na cestu do neznámých končin.


    Jako první k nám zavítá Tomáš Poláček, novinář a cestovatel. Od roku 2014
    pracuje pro měsíčník Reportér, kde naplňuje svůj sen - cestování autostopem
    kolem světa. Nejdříve vyrazil z Česka přes Sibiř do Severní Ameriky a
    následně až na jih do Ohňové země. Své zážitky posléze shrnul v knize STOP:
    Světové tažení ochmelky Poláčka. V roce 2017 se vydal na další velkou cestu
    stopem, tentokrát ze Střelkového mysu v Africe na Střelecký ostrov v Praze,
    kterou popisuje ve své zatím poslední knize Poslední stop: Afrika.


    Tomáš bude v rámci své přednášky mluvit o svých zážitcích z cest a o tom,
    jaké to je cestovat bez přípravy, na co je nutné myslet, na co nezapomenout
    a co očekávat.


    Vstup je dobrovolný. Jen díky Vašim příspěvkům můžeme v Paralelní Polis
    pořádat kvalitní program. Zakoupením rezervace místa tak přispějete Tomášovi
    na cestu k nám. Věříme, že se mu s jeho zkušenostmi povede přesvědčit
    dopravce, aby akceptoval platbu v bitcoinech :)


    Od 18:30 Vás zveme na neformální posezení v naší kavárně, kde představíme
    název projektu i podrobnosti o první destinaci a náplni naší mise. Samotná
    přednáška pak začne od 19:00.


    ▲▲▲

    CRYPTO TRUCK je projekt s cílem přinést do Afriky a celého světa nejnovější
    technologie a myšlenky udržitelného rozvoje, vztahu k naší planetě, ale také
    kryptoanarchie, digitální svobody, decentralizace a možnosti paralelní
    společnosti. Pojďte do toho s námi nebo nás podpořte a staňte se tak
    součástí tohoto neuvěřitelného příběhu.

    V rámci dalšího setkání Bitcoin Meetup prozkoumáme jednu z nejslibnějších
    aplikačních oblastí kryptoměn. Decentralizované finance staví na přirozených
    vlastnostech kryptoměnových systémů - vlastní správa klíčů, transparentní
    funkce, decentralizace. Jak na držených kryptoměnách kumulovat úrok či jak
    je využít k zajištění půjčky? A mohou být DeFi budovány i nad Bitcoinem?
    Přijďte na přednášku a následnou debatu s Krypto Josefem.


    Krypto Josef je kryptoměnový konzultant a publicista (Finmag.cz, BTCtip.cz,
    Alza.cz). Je spoluautorem podcastu Kryptokec. @KryptoJoseph na Twitteru.

    Paralelní Polis a společnost Lidská práva bez hranic společně připravili
    cyklus tří promítání, které nám na příkladu hnutí Falun Gong postupně
    představí různé způsoby omezování lidské svobody v Číně. Cílem tohoto cyklu
    je poukázat na celkové nastavení státní moci ve vztahu k občanům a omezování
    svobody jejich projevu, vyznání a práva na sebeurčení, na příkladu utrpení
    konkrétní skupiny lidí.


    V rámci prvního setkání si promítneme kanadský investigativní dokument
    Člověk na prodej - ilegální obchod s orgány v Číně, který odhaluje, jakým
    způsobem Čínská republika získává orgány pro transplantaci. Čína dlouho
    tvrdila, že orgány pocházejí od popravených vězňů, ale ukázalo se, že tato
    informace nebyla pravdivá, nakolik tyto orgány pocházely od lidí z hnutí
    praktikujících Falun Gong zabitých na objednávku.


    Po promítání bude následovat diskuse.


    Hranice svobody je cyklus zaměřený na zkoumání témat svobody a nezávislosti.
    V rámci Paralelní Polis považujeme za důležité hledat definici těchto pojmů,
    testovat jejich fungování a ptát se na to, jak je možné jich v současné
    společnosti dosahovat.

    V českém jazyce za posledních 30 let pojem “lobbing” (a především lobbista)
    zdomácněl - obohatil slovník politických nadávek. V obecnějším smyslu lze za
    “lobbování” považovat jakoukoliv formu prosazování skupinových zájmů. Pro
    environmentální zájmy je přitom typické, že proti sobě často stojí různé
    zájmy skupinové nebo zájem skupinový vůči zájmu individuálnímu. Nakládání s
    kůrovcem napadenými lesy, ochrana klimatu nebo rozšiřování chráněných území
    - ve všech případech je výsledné řešení plně závislé právě na konkrétních
    prosazených zájmech.


    Jak se environmentální zájmy prosazují v praxi? Mnohé úsilí směřuje k
    prosazení legislativního řešení. Existují i jiné cesty, ať už na lokální
    nebo globální úrovni. Jaké však mají jednotlivé přístupy dopad? Lze je vůbec
    měřit, abychom dospěli k důvěryhodným výsledkům? A jsou některé z nich
    použitelné univerzálně, nebo je každý vhodný v jiném měřítku?


    Podobných otázek bychom si mohli klást stovky, v konečném důsledku však jde
    vždy o to, které způsoby skutečně fungují a kdo je dokáže využít. V dalším
    díle Enviro Meetupu se pokusíme najít odpovědi na tyto otázky. Naši hosté
    Vám představí přístupy z pozice státní správy, neziskového sektoru, nebo
    podnikatelské sféry. Konkrétní jména budeme jako obvykle zveřejňovat
    postupně, máte se na co těšit!


    Enviro Meetup je pravidelným programem Paralelní Polis, jehož cílem je vést
    diskuzi o důležitých otázkách životního prostředí a trvalé udržitelnosti.

    Holochain is an open source software library, providing a way to build and
    run distributed peer-to-peer applications. It isn't a blockchain per se - it
    doesn't operate with global consensus. From the technological point of view,
    it is an amalgamation of Git and BitTorrent in a way, combining hash chains
    (every agent has his own chain), DHTs (distributed hash tables) and
    cryptographic signatures. It is "agent centric" in a sense that every agent
    writes their signed (and/or counter-signed) entries to his own source chain
    and then shares them to a DHT, where they are validated by other nodes
    according to the validation rules inherent to the hApp. If the rules are
    broken, the data is rejected. This predisposes Holochain for a different
    use-case set than blockchain, for which it allows for more efficiency,
    scalability and extendability. It is also well suited for decentralized
    identity and self-sovereign identity related solutions. Its core is
    implemented in Rust + WebAssembly, but the hApps can be developed using any
    language allowing WASM as a compile target.


    Within this talk, Jakub Lanc will introduce you to the basic premises of the
    Holochain technology and its applications. We'll have a quick look under the
    hood of the architecture, touch upon possible use cases and if desired, we
    can also walk through some actual hApp code. Jakub has a background in IT
    and psychology and is fond of the P2P commons initiatives. The project he
    has co-founded focuses on designing interfaces between social praxis and
    digital technology to foster deeper cooperation within and between
    peer-groups of young people. On the technical side, it entails Web-of-Trust
    related concepts (self-sovereign identity, peer micro-credentials), on the
    psycho-social side, he draws on insights and mentor support from different
    fields of psychotherapy, NVC and contextual behavioral science. He's also
    consulting the Liberland e-Residency project.

    Zákon Helena (2016) je film mladé herečky a dokumentaristky Petry
    Nesvačilové. Rozhodla se v něm zachytit policistku Helenu Kahnovou, které se
    spolu se svým kolegou podařilo v 90. letech poslat do vězení několik desítek
    lidí v kauze tzv. Berdychova gangu - včetně Berdycha samotného. Souhrnný
    trest byl v řádu stovek let odnětí svobody – policistka získala odměnu 10
    tisíc korun a povýšení, které jí následně bylo odebráno. Režisérce se
    podařilo navázat filmový vztah i se samotným Berdychem a bývalými členy jeho
    gangu.


    Co motivuje jednu policistku postavit se mafii a co mladou dokumentaristu,
    aby se s touto mafií kontaktovala a natočila o tom film?


    Petra Nesvačilová byla za celovečerní film Zákon Helena nominována na
    Českého lva a na cenu Arpa film festival v Los Angeles. Od svých 18 let
    hostovala v Divadlo Na zábradlí, v divadle Rubín a v Palác Akropolis. Na
    festivalu dokumentárních filmů Jeden svět / One World získala 3. místo ve
    studentské soutěži v literární oblasti a ve fotografii. Vystudovala FAMU,
    katedru dokumentární tvorby. Hraje v Divadlo Ungelt, VOSTO5 a u bratrů
    Cabanů. Spolupracuje také s humanitárními organizacemi Člověk v tísni, Český
    červený kříž a UNICEF Česká republika.

    V Evropě se dle statistik ročně vyhodí cca 89 milionů tun, celosvětově pak
    asi 1,2 až 2 miliardy tun potravin. Přitom 40 % potravinového odpadu vzniká
    až na konci řetězce, v našich domácnostech. Nalezení způsobu, jak zabránit
    takovému enormnímu plýtvání s potravinami, je jedním z nejdůležitějších
    výzev tohoto století.


    Proč dovážíme potraviny z druhého konce světa? Kolik z nich skončí v odpadu
    vlivem skladování a transportu? A jaká je vůbec kvalita takových potravin.
    Potřebujeme skutečně jahody v zimě a dýně na jaře? Avokádo k snídani a
    pomelo k večeři?


    A jaké je tedy řešení? Je lepší kompostování odpadu či jeho spalování v
    bioplynkách? Jak můžeme změnit své modely chování, abychom snížili jejich
    dopad na životní prostředí? Na tyto a spoustu dalších otázek budeme hledat
    odpovědi na našem dalším Enviro Meetupu. Sdílejte, zvěte své přátele a
    přijďte za námi diskutovat!

    Slyšeli jste již o nové směrnici Evropské unie týkající se ochrany
    autorských práv na internetu? Dva její kontroverzní články, konkrétně 11 a
    13, vzbuzují obavy o “konci svobodného internetu”. Jak se jejich aplikace
    projeví v praxi? Bude skutečně zajištěno právo autorů, nebo se opět spíše
    bude soustředit moc v rukách velkých hráčů? Co všechny vaše memy, remixy
    nebo gify? Jaký osud je čeká?


    Článek 13 je součástí směrnice Evropské unie týkající se ochrany autorských
    práv. Kontroverzní článek dává internetovým platformám povinnost řešit
    autorské právo za vlastníky práv. A to až do takového měřítka, že každý
    nahraný obsah (text, fotografie, video…) musí být už při nahrávání prověřen,
    zda autorská práva neporušuje. Článek 11 zase ukládá povinnost vyhledávačům
    a sociálním sítím platit za odkazy na články. Bývá označován jako „odkazová
    daň“.


    Hlasování proběhlo v úterý 26. března 2019: 348 hlasů pro, 274 proti, 36
    poslanců se zdrželo. Co to pro nás znamená?


    Účast v diskusi přislíbili:

    Parallel Societies have lifted mankind for the whole of recorded history,
    and continue to do so. We'll examine how they've risen and operated, how
    they changed they world, and how they felt to the people inside them.


    Paul Rosenberg will join us over videocall to talk about his experience with
    building parallel societies.

    The presentation will be roughly 45 mins., plus as much Q&A as is required.


    ► Paul Rosenberg is the author of the Free-Man’s Perspective newsletter, as
    well as a founder of a leading online privacy system, Cryptohippie. He has a
    broad range of interests and has been involved with cryptography projects
    since the 1990s.


    Prior to this, his construction and engineering career saw him called as an
    expert witness in numerous legal cases and recruited as a consultant to a
    number of organizations. He developed and taught 19 continuing education
    courses for Iowa State University’s College of Engineering. He also
    co-founded the Fiber Optic Association and wrote the first ever standard for
    the installation of fiber optic cables in buildings.


    An author of more than 60 books, including A Lodging of Wayfaring Men,
    Production Versus Plunder and The Breaking Dawn, Paul is a frequent speaker
    at conferences.

    • What we'll do

    https://www.facebook.com/events/731760587198086/


    At this lecture we will go through the necessary steps to create a
    transaction system which functions without any central authority. In this
    process, we will explain what blockchain is and what role it plays in
    Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. We will also explain the role of miners.
    In the end, we will discuss use cases of blockchain and areas where it is
    not useful at all.

    The lecture is a bit more technical, but still easy to understand for the
    general public.


    Jan Hubík is a cryptoanarchist and a hacker. He has formal education in
    multiple fields from physics to finance. Since 2013, he has been deeply
    interested in cryptocurrencies and decentralized systems from many points of
    view - from mining, investment, business use, to impact on society. He earns
    his living as a crypto-technology consultant and data scientist. Jan is a
    member of the Paralelni Polis supervisory board, where he focuses on the
    Institute of Cryptoanarchy. He produces multiple programmes, manages part of
    the finances and devotes the rest of his free time to spreading the word
    about cryptoanarchy.

    All-out strong polarization. Repeating tension between collectivists and
    individuals.

    This time with a new difference: Crypto technologies. Liberating us. Making
    us entirely responsible for all our decisions.


    This was short description of our Hackers Congress Paralelní Polis 2018. So
    let’s look back and see our hackers congress from different point of view
    with Tomáš Kolman and Jan Hubík.


    Paralelní Polis and Institute of Cryptoanarchy are still developing and
    working on something new. During #HCPP18 we were using for the first time
    our brand new streaming studio for making interviews. #HCPP18 Summary will
    take place at this studio so you can enjoy the new concept. Everybody is
    invited to come and listen to the speech directly at the studio.

    Through the concept of “silent disco” (headphones all around the place for
    listening the speech at a real time) you can listen to the speech while
    sitting in our Café sipping a good coffee and meeting new people.


    Tomáš Kolman is main coordinator of #HCPP. He will be talking about main
    ideas of #HCPP and how we are able to fill them.


    Jan Hubík is member of Supervisory Board of Paralelní Polis. He was
    moderator of many speakers on last hackers congress and as one of main guys
    behind this whole project he will be talking about headlines of #HCPP18 and
    what we were able to accomplish in comparison to past years.

    At first glance Peter lives the life of a typical European teenager – he
    lives with his parents, has a pretty girlfriend, he got into college.
    However, his real life is elsewhere – as the head of a paramilitary called
    “Slovenskí branci” that recruits hundreds of Slovak teenagers with the
    silent approval of the authorities. The group’s goal is simple - to prepare
    for a war time and create a model totalitarian-like community based on
    military drill, obedience and fear. Peter dreams that one day he will be
    able to convince the entire society - as a great politician.


    Film screening will be followed by discussion with director.

    We are pleased to announce the visit of one of the best hackers in the past.
    Patrick Kroupa will come to Prague.

    An entrepreneur, writer, hacker, and activist. During the 1980's he was a
    member of the Legion of Doom, one of the most influential hacking groups in
    the history of technology.


    Having grown bored of accessing systems that didn't belong to him, in 1991
    he co-founded MindVox, the first Internet Service Provider in New York, the
    third in the United States, and one of the first 500 dot coms ever
    registered.


    The speech will be about a historical first-person perspective starting with
    the "golden age" of cyberspace and the hacker and pirate underground of the
    1980s, the evolution of BBS systems into social networks on the internet,
    the birth of cypherpunk and PGP, eventually evolving into cryptocurrency,
    the darknet, and disruptive technologies bringing with them the possibility
    of a decentralized world where technology enables and preserves personal
    freedoms despite living within an all-encompassing surveillance planet,
    which seems to be incompatible with the concepts of anonymity, "freedom" and
    "privacy."

    This is an international event that started in Ukraine in October 2017 with
    1st Blockchain Art Hackathon where blockchain community worked hand-by-hand
    with artists to turn Blockchain ideas into pieces of art. Specialists,
    famous Bitcoin users and crypto enthusiasts gathered together with 30
    Ukrainian artists to create a brand-new, innovative trend in art. After the
    detailed acquaintance with the technology, the artists worked in the
    enclosed space for 48 hours to create their masterpieces.

    Art objects, created as a result of the hackathon, were presented at the
    exhibitions in the Ukraine. Each art object in the collection was tokenized.

    Copyrights were secured using Blockchain technology.

    Come with us to celebrate Pizza Bitcoin Day! On Tuesday 22.5. it will be
    exactly 8 years when the first bitcoin payment was made in the real world.
    It will be celebrated (of course) by pizza.


    It is called the most expensive pizza in history. Just eight years ago, at
    the bitcointalk.org forum, florid programmer Laszlo Hanyecz wrote an
    unprecedented offer of his time: "I'll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of
    pizzas ... for two big ones to keep me on the next day. If you are
    interested, let me know."


    The evening will be held in the spirit of informal discussion. You will meet
    Czech bitcoin authorities. All fans and opponents of cryptocurrencies are
    welcome.

    Can cryptocurrencies be money? What are the risks of using them and
    investing in them? Is Bitcoin a bubble? Or a scam? A Ponzi scheme? Can
    cryptocurrencies become eco-friendly and retain the security they offer?
    What can we expect in the future?


    Those and other issues will be discussed at a video conference with live
    audience in Paralelni Polis.


    The discussants are:

    Prof. Steve Keen - winner of Revere Award for Economics for predicting the
    Great Recession and author of Debunking Economics and Can we avoid another
    financial crisis,

    Frances Copolla – Forbes contributor on banking, finance, economics and
    cryptocurrency,

    Josef Tětek – Business analyst, economist and cryptocurrency expert,

    Ondřej Pilný – ICO specialist and co-founder of ICOindex.

    • What we'll do

    https://www.facebook.com/events/159793197887670/


    In January, Bitcoin celebrated its 9 years of existence, and its legacy that
    money can work completely differently, freely and without state supervision,
    will probably remain with us. Do you hear about Bitcoin for the first time,
    or you had no time to get to know it better? - Come to the lecture in
    Paralelní Polis and let yourself be introduced to its foundations.


    Where did Bitcoin come from and how does it work? Why is it a revolutionary
    invention that is comparable to the importance of the invention of the
    Internet. What is Bitcoin good for today and what can I expect from it in
    the future? Where can I buy Bitcoin and where can I use it?


    After the introductory lecture there will be time for your questions.


    The lecture will be led by Jan Hubík. Jan is a technology enthusiast and a
    hacker. He has formal education in multiple fields from physics to finance.
    Since 2013, he is deeply interested in cryptocurrencies and blockchain
    systems from many points of view - from mining, investment, business use, to
    impact on society. He earns his living as a crypto-technology consultant and
    data scientist. Jan is a member of the Paralelni Polis supervisory board,
    where he focuses on the Institute of Cryptoanarchy. He produces multiple
    programmes, manages part of the finances and devotes the rest of his free
    time to spreading the word about cryptoanarchy.

    Pontus and Ulrika sold all their stuff in 2015 after finishing their PhD’s
    at the Medical faculty in Linköping Sweden and have since then been
    travelling the world to meet up with fellow Bitcoiners and libertarians.


    At the meetup they will talk about their background, minimalist lifestyle,
    why the current economic system is something you want to opt out from and
    why they chose Bitcoin as their primary currency...

    Bitsquare is the first decentralized, open and secure Bitcoin exchange with
    privacy by design. — Bitsquare is not a company. Rather, it is implemented
    as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization with distributed ownership.


    During the meetup, Manfred Karrer, the creator of Bitsquare, will cover the
    questions why a decentralized Bitcoin exchange is needed and how to build
    it. He will focus on the political and conceptual aspects and will give a
    short demo of the software...

    Meetup is held in Czech, but you are welcome to visit us at our Bitcoin
    Coffee and have your first coffee for bitcoin anyway.


    Ambicí projektu Hivemind je předpovídat budoucnost pomocí decentralizované
    kolektivní mysli postavené na bitcoinovém blockchainu. Roger Ver prohlásil
    Hivemind za nejdůležitější projekt od Bitcoinu. Podobně i Tomáš Forgáč, host
    našeho setkání, jej považuje za jednu z mála skutečně významných aplikací
    blockchainové technologie. Proč? To se dozvíte v jeho přednášce již toto
    úterý.

    Finally a meetup in English! Let's watch a short documentary The Bitcoin
    Gospel and have a hangout with Roger Ver aka Bitcoin Jesus!


    The documentary looks at the history, the ideologies, and the conflict
    between the politics of the early-adopters and the VCs/entrepreneurs pushing
    to take Bitcoin mainstream. Roger Ver is ex-US citizen who has been a long
    time proponent of voluntaryism and is most well know for his work promoting
    Bitcoin.
