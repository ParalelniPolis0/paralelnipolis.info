    A collective promoting digital freedom and decentralized technologies. It focuses on cryptography and alternative economic models, aiming to empower individuals against censorship and surveillance.
  
  description: |
    The term cryptoanarchy describes the growing environment of the unregulated Internet, where unlimited data sharing and the development of the free market became possible by using anonymous tools such as decentralized currencies like bitcoin, and anti-spyware encryption tools.

    From the intervention of a live broadcast of Czech Television to the virtual interaction with politician’s mobile phones, we as members of the Ztohoven group are associated with hacking. The inspiration of technological innovation and it’s potential impact on society led us to a tight interaction with the hacker’s scene. As we understand the connection between the arts, science and technology as a tool to highlight the authoritarian tendencies which entered into our daily lives  with the development of modern technologies, we decided to join the international hackers network and to establish a hacker space called Institute of Cryptoanarchy.

    The aim of the Institute of Cryptoanarchy is to make available tools for unlimited dissemination of information on the Internet and encouraging a parallel decentralized economy, crypto-currencies and other conditions for the development of a free society in the 21st century.

    The main motive for us is the belief that censorship is not a phenomenon only in “the distant dictatorial world”.

    States and their security agencies globally control access to information and use the protection of intellectual property as an excuse to apply total censorship to control the available resources.

    The State on a global level  processes private mail and personal data, even though the European Court of Justice decided on the illegitimacy of “data retention”.

    The State and corporations have data on economic behavior, and through  legislation they have received  complete access to all payment transactions and consumer habits.

    New technology brings the possibility of choice – we are in a time that is defined by The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto.
    
    With a fast internet connection, reliable anonymity and decentralized currency, you preserve freedom which we have been losing as a society.

    The event series explores the technical and ideological challenges of scaling a decentralized cryptocurrency, bringing together the community to navigate these issues.
  description: |
    The legendary Bitcoin pizza transaction marks an important moment in the history of libre digital money. A small step, signalizing the birth of a whole era. It’s been 12 years since Bitcoin stepped into the world of payment networks for physical goods and opened the gates for the creation of a global parallel economy. Since then, we have experienced rather exponential growth in this new financial world. From a small community of cypherpunks and hackers, Bitcoin grew into a phenomenon with today’s mainstream recognition. Flourishing adoption upholds further levels, as the public interest always comes in waves. Yet with each wave passing by, the inspirational spirit of the original innovators fades a little bit more. Mass adoption poses continued challenges from governments, the public, and often the community itself. New questions about the purpose, scalability and sustainability arise every day. These are not going to solve themselves, nor disappear.

The project honors individuals who have fought for digital freedom and internet independence, often facing persecution for their beliefs and actions. The figures commemorated so far include:

    - **2017**: Ross Ulbricht
    - **2018**: Julian Assange
    - **2019**: Aaron Swartz
    - **2020**: Edward Snowden

    Each coin is connected to the decentralized world of cryptocurrency, particularly **Bitcoin**, containing the value of **0.01 BTC**. This link is facilitated through **BitNotes**, which are paper notes with unique BTC addresses tied to the coin. These notes include security features and are guaranteed by Paralelní Polis, though the organization has no direct access to the coins' BTC.

    ### BitNote and Bitcoin Integration

    - BitNotes have unique BTC addresses corresponding to private keys guaranteed by the company.
    - Paralelní Polis acts as a guarantor, but cannot access the BTC associated with the coins unless the second half of the code hidden under a scratch-off on the BitNote is revealed.

    ### Art and Leadership

    The project is led by **Roman Týc**, an artist and activist from the **Ztohoven** group, who also founded Paralelní Polis in 2014. He has a history of using technology in his art and activism. The production process of the coins combines craftsmanship and technology, symbolizing the fusion of art, science, and decentralized currency.

    ### Limited Edition

    Each annual edition is limited to **100 pieces**, with the molds destroyed afterward, enhancing the collectible and technological value of the coins.

    Koncept Paralelní polis lze rozklíčovat návštěvou espresso baru Bitcoin Coffee. Obrácený princip baru se zakládá na otevřeném a sdíleném výrobním postupu. Využití papírové voštiny reprezentuje hledání nových možností známých zajímavých materiálů. Bitcoin jako platební prostředek přivádí pozornost návštěvníka k využívání nových kryptotechnologií v praxi. Koncepce kavárny po vzoru berlínské kávové špičky, značky Bonanza Café, jako kávové laboratoře zacílené na dosažení špičkové chuti pak vyvolává zájem o doposud neobjevené kvality života. Pro pochopení složitých témat Paralelní polis je důležité posilnit se douškem silné kávy.
