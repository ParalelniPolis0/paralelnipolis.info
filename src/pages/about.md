We are a global online-first open community inspired by the concept of creating parallel social structures in society. Our roots trace back to Václav Benda's 1978 ["Paralelní Polis" essay](/t/paralelni-polis-essay) and the [Prague-based initiative](/s/pp-prague) (2014-2024), but today we operate as an independent global movement focused on empowering individuals through technology, education, and collaborative innovation.

We bring together people passionate about [many topics](/about#topics) like digital freedom, privacy, open technologies, and critical thinking about modern society's challenges. Our community thrives on the intersection of science, art, and emerging technologies, creating spaces for learning, experimentation, and meaningful discourse. Whether you're a developer, artist, philosopher, or simply curious about alternative social structures, you'll find opportunities here to connect, contribute, and grow with like-minded individuals from around the world.
