**Paralelní Polis** (Parallel Polis) was established in 2014 with the aim, among other things, to support the creation and development of parallel social structures in society and to educate the public in the use of tools for creating and engaging in these structures. In terms of ideas, Paralelní Polis builds on the ideas contained in [Václav Benda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A1clav_Benda)'s 1978 essay entitled [Paralelní Polis](/t/paralelni-polis-essay).

Paralelní Polis combines science, art and new technologies in its activities. It experiments with cryptocurrencies, self-sufficiency and open source technologies. One of the main activities of Polis is educating the wider public in these areas. Through its activities it tries to contribute to critical discussion of current issues and problems of modern society.
